Preface

\section{Preface}

This document contains my lecture notes for the third semester of
introductory physics. What actually happens in the class room may be very
different. I\ use an active approach with a classroom response system. But
if I\ were to lecture the whole time, this is what I\ would plan to say.
These notes also serve as a review of what we did in class and (and likely
more).

\chapter{Introduction: Motion and Environment\protect\footnote{%
Note to editors: Yes this is a chapter number 0. I know this is not
customary, but zero is a perfectly good number. There is no requirement that
a book start with chapter 0. So please don't change this. I want the new
material for the course to start with chapter 1. So don't undo hundreds of
years of mathematical debate and negate zero. It's a nice number.}}

If you are taking PH220 you should have already taken PH121 or an equivalent
class. In PH121, you learned about how things move. You learned about forces
and how force relates to acceleration%
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}=m\overrightarrow{\mathbf{a}}
\end{equation*}%
The force,$\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}},$ is how hard you push or pull. This
push or pull changes the motion of the object, represented by it's mass, $m.$
The change in motion is represented by its acceleration, $\overrightarrow{%
\mathbf{a}}.$ Notice that both $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}$ and $%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{a}}$ are vectors. We will need all that you learned
about vectors in PH121.

Since physics is the study of how things move, we are going to study the
motion of objects again in this class. But in this class we will learn about
new sources of force, that is, new ways to push or pull something.

Really these new sources of force are not entirely new. You have heard of
them and probably experienced them. They are electrical charge and
magnetism. You have probably had a sock stick from you after pulling it out
of a dryer, and you have probably had a magnet that sticks to your
refrigerator. So although these new sources of force are new to our study of
physics, they are somewhat familiar in every day lives.

To get us started this semester I\ want to review a particular force, the
force due to gravity. Think of most of our experience with gravity. We have
an object moving near the Earth. There is a force acting on the object, and
that force is because of Earth's gravity.

We can think of the Earth as creating an environment in which the object
moves, feeling the gravitational force.

Think of a ball falling, We considered this as an environment of constant
acceleration. In this environment, the ball feels a force proportional to
their mass%
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}=m\overrightarrow{\mathbf{g}}
\end{equation*}%
where $g=9.81\frac{\unit{m}}{\unit{s}}$ is the acceleration due to gravity.
This is true anywhere near the Earth's surface. We could draw this situation
as follows:

\FRAME{dtbpF}{3.4504in}{1.9842in}{0in}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language
"Scientific Word";type "GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio TRUE;display
"USEDEF";valid_file "T";width 3.4504in;height 1.9842in;depth
0in;original-width 3.4876in;original-height 1.993in;cropleft "0";croptop
"1";cropright "1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename
'NAJBC703.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}where the environment for
constant acceleration is drawn as a series of arrows in the acceleration
direction (downward toward the center of the Earth). Anywhere the ball goes
the environment is the same. So we draw arrows all around the ball to show
that the whole environment around the ball is the same.

This environment is caused by the Earth being there. If the Earth suddenly
disappeared, then the acceleration would just as suddenly go to zero. So we
can say that the Earth creates this constant acceleration environment.

Notice that there are two objects involved, the ball and the Earth. Also
notice that one object creates an environment that the other object moves
in. In our case, the Earth created the environment and the ball moved
through the environment. This situation will recur many times in our course,
so let's give the objects these names, the Earth as the \textquotedblleft
Environmental object\textquotedblright , and the ball as the
\textquotedblleft mover.\textquotedblright

Now you might object, because the force of gravity requires both objects, so
how can we be sure that we have chosen the right objects to be the
environmental object and the mover? Well, you remember that this depends on
which reference frame we use to view the situation. Since we are sitting on
the Earth, it is most common to see the Earth as sitting still and the ball
going by. Then the Earth is the environmental object and the ball is the
mover. But if we were a fly sitting on the ball, we might see the ball as
the environmental object and the Earth as the mover!

Both views are equally valid! It is easier to view the Earth as the
environmental object, though, and we will find that in our problems this
semester it is important to look at our problems to see which reference
frame will let us get a solution easier.

The important thing here is to view the situation as an environment and it's
environmental object with a mover object moving through the environment.

\chapter{Charge}

In the past two courses our goal was to learn now things move. We learned in
PH121 and/or ME204 how objects move. We learned all about Newton's laws
which are our description of how things move. If you have taken PH 123 you
learned how groups of things move, like water molecules in waves or air
molecules in the room. We also learned about how light moves, but there was
a mystery there that we need to illuminate this semester. That is, we really
did not deal with the mechanics of how you make light. By the time we are
done this semester you will know how this works!

But most of the semester we will learn about the cause of a particular
force, the force created by electric charge. You have probably felt this
force when you put on a sweater that has a static charge. You may have found
a stray sock sticking to your sweater. (hopefully before you wore it to
class). This semester we will learn about this force and the magnetic force.
Then, of course, we can apply these new forces to our dynamics problems from
PH121 to see things move in new ways. We start, then, with the source of
these new forces. Charge

\begin{itemize}
\item There is a property of matter called \textquotedblleft
charge.\textquotedblright

\item There seem to be two types of charges, called \textquotedblleft
positive\textquotedblright\ and \textquotedblleft negative.\textquotedblright

\item We have a model for how charge acts. The model tells us there are two
types of charge, and that charges of similar type repel and charges of
different type attract.

\item We call the types of charge \textquotedblleft
positive\textquotedblright\ and \textquotedblleft negative\textquotedblright

\item In metals, the valence electrons are free to move around. We call
materials where the charges move \textquotedblleft
conductors.\textquotedblright

\item Materials where the valence electrons cannot move are called
\textquotedblleft insulators.\textquotedblright

\item In insulators, the atoms can \textquotedblleft

\section{What is Charge}

But what is charge? How do we know there are such things as charged
particles?

That is the subject we will take up next. Then we will study the motion and
actions of these charged particles. Finally we will show that the fields
made by charged particles can act as a medium for waves, and that there is
good evidence that those waves exist.

\subsection{Evidence of Charge}

Let's start with something we all know. Let's rub a balloon in someone's
hair. If we do this we will find that the balloon sticks to the wall. Why?

\end{minipage}
}%
%EndExpansion
We say the balloon and comb have become \emph{charged}. What does this mean?
We will have to investigate this more as we learn more about how matter is
structured, but for now let's assume charge is some property that provides
this phenomena we have observed with the balloon (i.e. it sticks to the
wall). Now lets try rubbing other things. We could rub two rubber or plastic
rods.

%TCIMACRO{%

'N8ESC50P.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}Now the two different rods
attract each other.

Notice that in our demo, rods that are the same repel and rods that are
different attract. We make the intellectual leap that the different rods
have different charges. So we are really saying:

\begin{enumerate}
\item There are two types of charge.

\item Charges that are the same repel one another and charges that are
different

attract one another.

\item Friction seems to produce charge, but you have to rub the right
materials

together.
\end{enumerate}

We will call the rubber or plastic rod charges \emph{negative} and the glass
rod charges \emph{positive} but the choice is arbitrary. Ben Franklin is
credited with making the choice of names. He really did not know much about
charge, so he just picked two names (we will see that in some ways his
choice was somewhat unfortunate, but hay, he was an early researcher who
helped us understand much about charge , so we will give him a break!).

\subsection{Types of Charge}

We now have reason to believe that there are at least two types of charge,
one for rubber and one for glass. But are there more?

Let's start by introducing a new object, only this time we won't rub it with
anything.%
%TCIMACRO{%

\begin{minipage}[t]{1in}

\end{minipage}
}%
%EndExpansion

Now this is strange. The new item is attracted to both rods! What is going
on? Have we discovered a new type of charge, one that attracts the other two
types we have found?

Maybe, but maybe the explanation of this phenomena is a little different. To
understand this, let's consider how charge moves around.%

\subsection{Movement of Charge}

One of the strange things about charge is that it is \emph{quantized}. We
learned this word in when we found that only certain standing waves could be
formed between boundaries. We are using this word in a similar way now. It
means that charge has a smallest unit, and that it only comes in whole
number multiples of that unit. Charge comes in a basic amount that can't be
divided into smaller amounts. So like our standing wave frequencies, only
certain amounts are possible As far as we know, the smallest amount of
charge possible is the electron charge.\footnote{%
I am not counting quarks here, which have a charge of $\frac{1}{3}$ or $%
\frac{2}{3}$ of the basic electron charge. But still, $\frac{1}{3}$ of the
basic electron charge seems to be a real fundamental unit.} This charge we
will call negative. We say that the electron is the principle charge carrier
for negative charge. This fundamental unit of charge was found to be about%
\begin{equation}
e=1.60219\times 10^{-19}\unit{C}
\end{equation}%
where the $\unit{C}$ stands for \emph{Coulomb, }the $SI$ unit of charge.

Any larger charge must be a multiple of this fundamental charge%
\begin{equation}
Q=n\times e
\end{equation}

The proton is the principle charge carrier for positive charge. From
chemistry, you know protons are located in the nucleus of an atom, along
with the neutron. In the Bohr model of the atom, the nucleus is surrounded
by a cloud of electrons. The proton has the same amount charge as the
electron ($e$), but is opposite in sign.

In a gram of mater, there are many, many, units of charge. There are about $%
\allowbreak 5.\,\allowbreak 012\,5\times 10^{22}$ carbon atoms in one gram
of carbon. Each carbon atom has twelve protons and about twelve electrons.
That is a lot of charge! But notice that the net charge is zero (or very
close to it!). It is common for most mater to have zero net charge.

As far as we know, charge is always conserved. We can create charge, but
only in plus or minus pairs, so the net charge does not change. We can
destroy charge, but we end up destroying both a positive and a negative
charge at the same time. The net charge in the universe does not seem to
change much. So when something becomes charged, we expect to find that the
charge has come from another object.

Lets go back to our rubber rod and glass rod demo. We rubbed the rod that
was in our hand, but where did the charge come from? We believe that we are
moving charge carriers (usually electrons) from one object to another,
stripping them from their atoms. This happens when we use friction (rubbing)
to charge the rods.

But what about our object that we did not rub, or our paper (we did not rub
the bits of paper). We believe that charge can move, that is why scientists
looked for and found charge carriers. Even in an atom, if I\ bring a charged
object near the atom then the negative charge carriers (electrons) will
experience a force directed away from the charged object, and the positively
charged nucleus will experience a force pulling toward the charge object 
\FRAME{dhF}{1.695in}{0.9556in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language
"Scientific Word";type "GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio TRUE;display

'N8ESC50Q.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}Notice that the electrons and the
nucleus will \emph{attract} each other, so the atom won't split apart. But
it will become positively charged on one side because there are more
positive charge carriers on that side. It will become more negatively
charged on the other side, because there are more negative charge carriers
on that side. We could draw the atom like this (figure \ref{Polarized_Atom})%
\FRAME{fhFU}{0.8761in}{0.4557in}{0pt}{\Qcb{Polarized Atom}}{\Qlb{%

'N8ESC50R.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}The force due to charge depends
on how far away the charges are from each other. The attractive force
between the positively charged side of the atom and the negative rod will
have a stronger force than the negatively charged side of the atom and
negatively charged rod will experience because the negative side if farther
away. We will say that the atom has become \emph{polarized}. \FRAME{dhF}{%

The positive side will experience an attractive force. The negative side
will experience a repelling force. The net force due to the charge will be
an attractive force. The atom will be accelerated toward the rod! We have
seen something like this before. Remember an object in a fluid experiences a
downward pressure force on the top, and an upward pressure force on the
bottom. The pressure force is larger on the bottom, so there is an upward
Buoyant force. The case with our polarized atom is very similar. We have a
net electrical attractive force.\FRAME{dtbpF}{2.7873in}{0.5509in}{0pt}{}{}{%

'N8ESC50T.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}Now suppose we have lots of atoms
(like our uncharged object or our bits of paper). Will they be attracted to
the rod? Yes!

How about if we use a glass rod?

switch the signs. The glass rod is positively charged. It will attract the
electrons, and repel the nucleus. The atom becomes charged. The net force is
attractive (positive rod and closer negative side of the atom)

We sometimes call the separation of charge in an insulator \emph{polarization%
}.

\subsection{Flow of Charge}

Let's start by introducing a new object, a salt shaker (my salt shaker is
glass with a metal top). We will rub the salt shaker and see if it gets
charged by placing it next to our charged rods.%
%TCIMACRO{%
%\TeXButton{Salt Shaker Demo}{\marginpar {

%BeginExpansion
\marginpar {

\begin{minipage}[t]{1in}
\small{Salt Shaker Demo}

}%
%EndExpansion

Now this is strange. We rubbed the object, but it was attracted to both rods
as if there were no charge. We know glass can be charged. What is the
problem?

%TCIMACRO{%
%\TeXButton{Question 223.19.6}{\marginpar {

\small{Question 223.19.6}

}%
%EndExpansion
It turns out that some materials allow charge carriers to flow through them.
Our experience with the lighting in our house might suggest that metals will
do this. Let's try some other metal objects and see what we find.%
%TCIMACRO{%
%\TeXButton{Metal Demo}{\marginpar {

%EndExpansion

It seems that the atoms are not maintaining a charge separation in these
metal atoms! Some materials allow charge carriers to move through them.
Usually these materials are metals, but most materials will allow some
charge to go through them-even you-which is what is happening in this case.
I\ charge the rod, but the charge leaves through my body. Other materials
resist the flow of charge. Materials that allow charge to flow are called 
\emph{conductors}. Materials that resist the flow of charge are called \emph{%
insulators}.

\subsection{Charging by Induction}

Knowing that charge carriers can flow though a material, we can think of a
way to charge a conductor. Lets suspend a conducting rod.

other end of the rod to allow the charge to flow away from our conducting
rod. We will connect the rod to the ground (in this case, to a water pipe)
because the ground seems to be able to accept large amounts of charge
carriers. So the charge carriers will flow to the ground.

different in our study of this new force. In the past, it was easy to tell
which object was creating the environment and which was the mover. The
Earth, being so much larger than normal objects, was the environmental
object creating the gravitational acceleration that balls and cars and
people move it. Then the balls and cars and people were the movers.
Generally the thing causing the force, the environmental object, was much
bigger than the mover. That is not true in our charge experiments so far.
The rods are about the same size. So which is the environmental object and
which is the mover? We will have to pick one to be our environmental object,
and the other to be our mover. Sometimes the context of the problem helps.
If the problem you are solving asks for the motion or the force on the rod
on the right side of the diagram, then it is the mover and the rod on the
left is the environmental object. If one charge is much larger than the
other, we might be justified in calling this large charge the environmental
object and a smaller charge near the big charge would be the mover.

\section{Model for Charge}

A model is a mental explanation for something. We are looking for a model,
or an explanation of how charge acts.

Let's summarize what we tried to learn last time:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{tabular}{|c|}
\hline
{\large Model for Charge} \\ \hline
{\small Frictional forces can add or remove charge from an object} \\ \hline
{\small There are two, and only two kinds of charge} \\ \hline
{\small Two objects with the same kind of charge repel each other} \\ \hline
{\small To objects with different kinds of charge attract each other} \\ 
\hline
{\small The force between two charged objects is long ranged} \\ \hline
{\small The force between two charged objects decreases with distance} \\ 
\hline
{\small Uncharged objects have an equal mix of both kinds of charge} \\ 
\hline
\begin{tabular}{l}
{\small There are two types of materials, conductors (in which charges can
move)} \\ 
{\small and insulators (in which charges are fixed in place)}%
\end{tabular}
\\ \hline
{\small Charge can be transferred from one object to another by contact
between the two objects} \\ \hline
\end{tabular}%
\end{equation*}

A serious shortcoming of this model is that it does not tell us what charge
is. This is a shortcoming we will have to live with. We don't know what
charge is any more than we can say exactly what mass or energy are. Charge
is fundamental, as far as we can tell. We can't find a way to change charge
into something else to change something else into charge. For fundamental
particles (like protons and electrons) either a particle has charge, or it
does not.

\subsection{Conservation of charge}

In some ways, this is really great! We have a new quantity that does not
ever change. We can say that charge is conserved in the universe. Like
energy, we can move charge around, but we don't create or destroy it%
\footnote{%
There is really a way to create charge, but you have to create both a
positive and a negative charge together, so the net charge in the universe
never changes.}. When we rubbed the plastic rods with rabbit fur or wool, we
were removing charge that was already there in the atoms of the fur. If you
take PH279 you might find that there are some caveats to this rule. We can
make positron and electron pairs from high energy gamma rays. But when we do
this we must always make a pair; one positive, and one negative. So the net
charge remains unaffected.

\section{Insulators and Conductors}

Let's return to charges and atoms. We have an intuitive feeling for what is
a conductor and what is an insulator, but let's see why conductors act the
way they do.

\subsection{Potential Diagrams for Molecules}

Back in high school or in a collage chemistry class you learned that
electrons move around an atom. \FRAME{dhF}{2.3376in}{1.6907in}{0pt}{}{}{%
Figure}{\special{language "Scientific Word";type

energy states represented. You may even remember the names of these energy
states. The orange-yellow lines show one \textquotedblleft orbital
distance\textquotedblright\ for the electrons near the nucleus. The red line
shows another electron at a larger orbital distance. The inner orbital is a $%
1s$ state and the outer orbital is a $2s$ state. If these were satellites
orbiting the earth, you would recognize that the two orbits have different
amounts of potential energy. This is also true for electrons in orbitals. If
we plot the potential energy for each state we get something that looks like
this\FRAME{dhF}{2.066in}{1.5912in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language
"Scientific Word";type "GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio TRUE;display

'N8ESC514.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}You can think of this as
potential energy \textquotedblleft shelves\textquotedblright\ where we can
put electrons. If you were a advanced high school student, you learned that
on the first two shelves you can only fit two electrons each. The higher
shelves can take six, and so forth. But that won't concern us in this class.

\subsection{Building a solid}

Note also that so far I have really only talked about single atoms. What
happens when we bind atoms together?

Let's take two identical atoms. When they are far apart, they act as
independent systems. But when they get closer, they start acting like one
quantum mechanical system. What does that mean for the electrons in the
atoms?

Electrons are funny things. They won't occupy the exactly the same energy
state. I can only have two electrons in a $1s$ state, but as I\ bring two
atoms near each other I\ will have four! How does the compound solve this
problem? The energy \textquotedblleft shelves\textquotedblright\ split into
more shelves. As the atoms get closer, we see something like this\FRAME{dtbpF%
}{2.7216in}{2.1119in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language "Scientific

"1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename 'N8ESC515.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}%
At some distance, $r,$ the states split. So each electron is now in a
different state. Suppose we bring $5$ atoms together.\FRAME{dtbpF}{3.1488in}{%
2.444in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language "Scientific Word";type

states. Now I have five different $1s$ states, enough for $5$ atoms worth of 
$1s$ electrons. But solids have more than five atoms. Let's bring many atoms
together.\FRAME{dtbpF}{3.0338in}{2.3549in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special%

"1";cropright "1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename
'N8ESC517.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}Now there are so many states that
we just have a blue blur in between the original two split states. We have
created a nearly continuous set of states in two bands. Each electron has a
different energy, but those energy differences might be tiny fractions of a
Joule. The former two states have almost become continuous bands of allowed
energy states.

The atoms won't allow themselves to be too close. They will reach an
equilibrium distance, $r_{o}$ where they will want to stay. \FRAME{dtbpF}{%
2.9092in}{2.3791in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language "Scientific
Word";type "GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio TRUE;display "USEDEF";valid_file

"1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename 'N8ESC518.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}%
Since this is where the atoms usually are. We will not draw the whole
diagram anymore. We will instead just draw bands at $r_{o}.$(along the
dotted line). Here is an example.

\FRAME{dtbpF}{2.5503in}{2.7138in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language
"Scientific Word";type "GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio TRUE;display

"1";cropright "1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename
'N8ESC519.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}

This means we have \emph{bands} of energies that are allowed, that electrons
can use, and \emph{gaps} of energy where no electron can exist.

\section{Conduction in solids}

Notice that in our last picture, the $3s$ and $3p$ bands have grown so much
that they overlap. The situation with solids is complicated. Notice also
that the lower states are blue. We will let blue mean that they are filled
with electrons taking up every available energy state. The upper states are
only partially filled. Yellow will mean the energy states are empty. We will
call the highest completely filled band the \emph{valance band} and the next
higher empty band the $\emph{conduction}$ band.

We have three different conditions possible.

\subsection{metals}

In a metal, the highest occupied band is only partially filled\FRAME{dtbpF}{%
2.3091in}{0.7178in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language "Scientific
Word";type "GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio TRUE;display "USEDEF";valid_file

"1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename 'N8ESC51A.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}%
the electrons in this band require only very little energy to jump to the
next state up since they are in the same band and the allowed energies are
very closely spaced. Remember that movement requires energy. So if I connect
a battery to provide energy, the electrons must be allowed to gain the extra
energy, kinetic energy in this case, or they will not move. But in the case
of a metal, there are easily accessible energy states, and the electrons
flow through the metal.

We can say that the outer electrons are shared by all the atoms of the
entire metal, so the electrons are easy to move for metals.

\subsection{Insulators}

A second condition is to have a full valance band and an empty conduction
band. The bands are separated by an energy gap of energy $E_{g}.$

\FRAME{dtbpF}{1.6535in}{1.7244in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language
"Scientific Word";type "GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio TRUE;display
"USEDEF";valid_file "T";width 1.6535in;height 1.7244in;depth

"1";cropright "1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename
'N8ESC51B.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}In this case, it would take a
whopping big battery to make the electrons move. the battery would have to
supply all of the gap energy plus a little more to get the electron to move.
If we do connect a very large battery, say, $33000\unit{V},$ then we can get
electrons to jump the gap to a higher energy \textquotedblleft
shelf.\textquotedblright\ But high voltages are not normal conditions, so
this is not usually the case. A material that has a large energy gap between
it's valance band and an empty conduction band is called an insulator.

A mental picture for this might be as shown in the next figure.

\FRAME{dhF}{3.2301in}{1.9605in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

valence electrons bound to the nuclei of the atoms. But for a conductor, the
valence electrons are free to travel from atom to atom.%

In an isolated conductor, normally the charge is balanced, so the electrons
may move but generally they stay near a nucleus. But if a conductor has
extra electrons, the electrons that can move will move because they repel
each other. So any extra charge will be on the surface of the conductor.

\FRAME{dhF}{1.1467in}{1.1718in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

'N8ESC61D.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}

This happens very quickly, generally we do find the extra charge distributed
on the outside of a conductor.

\subsection{Semiconductors}

The third choice is that there is a band gap, but the band gap is small. In
this case, some electrons will gain enough thermal energy to cross the gap.
Then these electrons will be in the conduction band. Devices that work this
way are called semiconductors. We won't deal with semiconductors much in
this class, but you probably used many of them in ME210. Diodes, and
transistors are made from semiconductors.

\subsection{Charging and discharging conductors}

Conductors can't usually be charged by rubbing. The electrons in the
conductor may move when rubbed, but then they are free to move around in the
conductor, so they don't leave. But if we rub an insulator, the electrons
are not free to travel in the insulator material, so we can break them free.
Once this happens, we can take our charged insulator and place it in contact
with a conductor. The charge can flow from the insulator to the conductor
(and arrange itself on the conductor surface). Once the charge has moved to
the exterior, it will reach what we call \emph{electrostatic equilibrium}.
All of the repelling electrical forces are in balance, so the charges come
to rest with respect to the conductor.

We can remove the extra charge by creating a path for the charge to follow.
Consider charging a balloon by rubbing it on your hair. Then you connect a
wire to the balloon that is also connected to a metal water pipe. The charge
can flow through the metal conducing wire. If there is a large body that can
attract extra charge, the charge will flow. The Earth is such a large body
that can attract the extra charge. The charge will flow through the wire and
pipe and go into the ground.

You may have heard of electrical grounds. This literally means tying your
device to the Earth through a wire. Since you are made mostly of water that
contains positive ions, you are also a conductor. So if we touch a charged
object, we will most likely discharge the object. This is also why we must
be careful with charge. Large amounts of charge flowing through us leads to
death or injury.

If an object is \emph{grounded}, it cannot build up extra charge. This is
good for appliances and houses, and people.

Notice that the negative and positive center of charge are not in the same
place when the atom is polarized. We have a name for a pair of positive and
negative charges that are separated by a distance, but that are still bound
together. We call it an \emph{electric dipole.} Often we just draw the

Thus if you have a charged balloon on a humid day, one side of the water
molecules in the air will be attracted to the extra charge on the balloon.
The extra charge will attach to the water molecules, and float away with
them. This will discharge the balloon.

\section{Note on drawing charge diagrams}

We will have to draw diagrams in our problem solutions. Normally we won't
draw atoms, so we will be drawing large objects with or without extra
charge. We know that all materials have positive nuclei and negative
electrons. When these are balanced, there is an electron for every proton,
so if we add up the charges we get zero net charge. These charges don't
contribute to net forces because for every attraction there is a repulsion
of equal magnitude.

So we won't draw all of these charges, but we should remember they are
there. We usually draw a cross section, so here is the cross section of a
round, conducting ball.\FRAME{dhF}{1.3318in}{1.26in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{%

should draw it. We will just add plus signs or minus signs. We won't draw
little circles to show the electrons (we can't draw them to scale, they are
phenomenally small). Here is an example of two round objects, one positive
and one negative\FRAME{dhF}{2.5157in}{1.2445in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special%

From our experience we know that more massive things exert a stronger
gravitational pull than less massive things. We also have some idea that the
farther away an object is, the less the gravitational pull. Newton expressed
this as 
\begin{equation*}
F_{g}=G\frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{r_{12}^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
where the two masses involved (say, the Earth and you) are $m_{1}$ and $%
m_{2} $ and the distance between the two masses is $r_{12}$ (e.g. the
distance from the center of the Earth to the center of you). The constant $G$
is a constant that puts the force into nice units that are convenient for us
to use, like newtons $\left( \unit{N}\right) .$ It has a value of 
\begin{equation*}
G=6.67428\times 10^{-11}\frac{\unit{N}\unit{m}^{2}}{\unit{kg}^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
You might ask, how do we know this? The answer is that Newton and others
performed experiments. Newton's law of gravitation is empirical, meaning
that it came from experiment. Lord Cavendish used a clever device to verify
this law. He suspended two masses from a wire. Then he placed two other
masses near the suspended masses. \FRAME{dhF}{2.2502in}{2.6091in}{0pt}{}{}{%

the wire (how much it resists being twisted). Then by observing how far the
suspended masses moved, he could work out the strength of the gravitational
force. This is called a torsion balance.

Charles Coulomb thought he could use the same device to measure the strength
of the electric force. Here is his experimental design. \FRAME{dhFU}{2.2502in%

is inversely proportional to the distance between their centers

\item It is proportional to the product of the magnitudes of the charges $%

\item It is attractive (the charges accelerate towards each other) if the
charges have different signs, and is repulsive (the charges accelerate away
from each other) if the charges have the same signs.
\end{enumerate}

Note how much this looks like gravitation! In the denominator, we have the
distance, $r_{12}$, between the two charged particles' centers. We have two
things in the numerator. But now we have $\left\vert q_{1}\right\vert $ and $%
\left\vert q_{2}\right\vert $ instead of $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}.$ We have a
constant $k_{e}$ instead of $G,$ but the equation is very much like Newton's
law of gravitation. That should be comforting, because we know how to use
Newton's law of gravitation from PH121 or Dynamics. There is a very big
difference, though. Gravitation can only attract masses, The Force due to
charges can attract \emph{or} \emph{repel}.

Again there is a constant to fix up the units. Our constant is 
\begin{equation}
k_{e}=8.9875\times 10^{9}\frac{\unit{N}\unit{m}^{2}}{\unit{C}^{2}}
\end{equation}%
which allows us to use more meaningful units (to us humans) in the force
equation.

Lets try an example problem:

\begin{example}
Calculate the magnitude of the electric force between the proton and
electron in a hydrogen atom. Compare to their gravitational attraction. We
expect the electrical force to be larger. We need some facts about Hydrogen%
\begin{equation*}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
Item & Value \\ \hline
Proton Mass & $1.67\times 10^{-27}\unit{kg}$ \\ \hline
Electron Mass & $9.11\times 10^{-31}\unit{kg}$ \\ \hline
Proton Charge & $1.6\times 10^{-19}\unit{C}$ \\ \hline
Electron Charge & $-1.6\times 10^{-19}\unit{C}$ \\ \hline
Proton-electron average separation & $5.3\times 10^{-11}\unit{m}$ \\ \hline
\end{tabular}%
\end{equation*}%
then,%
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{e} &=&k_{e}\frac{\left\vert q_{1}\right\vert \left\vert q_{2}\right\vert 
}{r^{2}} \\
&=&8.9875\times 10^{9}\frac{\unit{N}\unit{m}^{2}}{\unit{C}^{2}}\frac{\left(
-1.6\times 10^{-19}\unit{C}\right) \left( 1.6\times 10^{-19}\unit{C}\right)

&=&-\allowbreak 8.\,\allowbreak 190\,8\times 10^{-8}\frac{\unit{m}}{\unit{s}%
^{2}}\unit{kg}
\end{eqnarray*}%
and%
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{g} &=&G\frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}} \\
&=&6.67\times 10^{-11}\unit{N}\frac{\unit{m}^{2}}{\unit{kg}^{2}}\frac{\left(
1.67\times 10^{-27}\unit{kg}\right) \left( 9.11\times 10^{-31}\unit{kg}%

&=&\allowbreak 3.\,\allowbreak 612\,5\times 10^{-47}\frac{\unit{m}}{\unit{s}%
^{2}}\unit{kg}
\end{eqnarray*}%
which shows us what we expected, the gravitational force is very small
compared to the electric force.

\subsection{Permittivity of free space}

\epsilon _{o}=\frac{1}{4\pi k_{e}}=8.85\times 10^{-12}\frac{\unit{C}^{2}}{%

which really does not seem to be an improvement. But if you go on to take an
advanced class in electrodynamics you will find that this form is more
convenient in other unit systems. So we will adopt it even though it is an
inconvenience now.

What about direction? So far we have only calculated the magnitude of the
force. But a force is a vector, so it must have a direction. Notice that our
equation has absolute value signs in it. We will only get positive values
from Coulomb's law.

To find a strategy for getting the direction, let's observe two charged
objects\FRAME{dhF}{1.1459in}{1.0464in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language
"Scientific Word";type "GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio TRUE;display

"1";cropright "1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename
'N8ESC61Q.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}Experiments show that they seem
to be pulled straight toward each other. The force seems to be along the
line that passes through the center of charge for each of the two charged
objects. We have to find this line from the geometry of our situation and
our choice of coordinate systems. To make matters worse, we could have two
of the same kind of charge.

\FRAME{dhF}{1.0905in}{0.9764in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

"1";cropright "1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename
'N8ESC61R.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}The force will still be on the
line connecting the centers of charge, but it will be in the opposite
direction compared to the last case where the charges were of different
sign. This seems complicated, and it is. We must observe the geometry of our
situation and note whether the charges are the same or different signs to
find the direction. Our equations can't tell us the direction on their own.
You can't put the signs of the charges into the formula and expect a
direction to come out! You have to draw the picture. Here is the process:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Define your coordinate system.

\item Find the line that connects the centers of charge. The force direction
will be on that line.

\item Determine the direction by observing the signs of the charges. If the
charges have the same sign, the force will be repulsive, if the charges have
different signs, it will be attractive.
\end{enumerate}

\section{More than two charges}

It is great that we know the force between two charges, but we have learned
that there are billions of charges in everything we see or touch. It would
be nice to be able to use our simple law of force on more than one or two
charges. We did this with gravity. Let's review.%

Suppose I have a satellite orbiting the Earth. That satellite feels a force
given by 
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{g} &=&G\frac{M_{E}m_{s}}{r^{2}} \\
&=&G\left( \frac{M_{E}}{r^{2}}\right) m_{s}
\end{eqnarray*}%
but consider that on the Earth below the satellite, there is a rock on the
surface of the Earth. \FRAME{dhF}{3.0606in}{2.2883in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{%

on the satellite must be due to this rock. We could write our force due to

F_{g}=G\left( \frac{M_{rest}}{r_{rest}^{2}}\hat{r}_{rest}+\frac{M_{rock}}{%
r_{s}^{2}}\hat{r}_{rock}\right) m_{s}
\end{equation*}%
where $M_{rest}$ is the mass of all the rest of the Earth, minus the rock.
If we take the Earth rock by rock, we would have%
\begin{equation*}
F_{g}=G\left( \Sigma _{i}\frac{M_{i}}{r_{i}^{2}}\mathbf{\hat{r}}_{i}\right)
m_{s}
\end{equation*}%
where $M_{i}$ is the mass of the $i^{th}$ piece of the Earth and $\mathbf{%
\hat{r}}_{i}$ is the direction from $M_{i}$ to $m_{s}$. We would not really
want to do this calculation, because it would take a long time. Instead,
back in PH121 or Dynamics we found we could add up all the mass and treat
the Earth as one big ball of mass and represent it as if the mass was all at
it's center of mass (as long as there is no rotation so no torque). But
let's think about all this mass. Does the force between a rock in China and
our satellite get diminished because our rock in Rexburg is in the way? 
\FRAME{dhF}{4.3059in}{3.1955in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

really the sum of all the little forces between all the parts of the Earth
and our satellite. One bit of mass does not interfere with the force from
another bit of mass.

Now let's look at the electric force. Suppose we have many charges in some
configuration (maybe a round ball of charge). We could call the total
charge, $Q.$ Then our force magnitude on a mover charge $q_{o},$ would be 
\begin{equation*}
F_{e}=k_{e}\frac{\left\vert Q\right\vert \left\vert q_{o}\right\vert }{r^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
The collection of charge $Q$ would be the environmental charge. But we can
picture this as the individual parts of $Q$ all with little forces pairs
acting on $q_{o}$ summing up to get $F_{e}.$%
\begin{equation*}
F_{e}=k_{e}\Sigma _{i}\left( \frac{\left\vert Q_{i}\right\vert }{r_{i}^{2}}%
\mathbf{\hat{r}}_{i}\right) \left\vert q_{o}\right\vert
\end{equation*}%
where $Q_{i}$ is a piece of the total charge $Q.$

This is an amazingly simple idea. The force on a mover charge, $q_{o},$ due
to any number of charges is just the sum of the forces due to each charge
acting on $q_{o}.$ Sometimes the mover charge is called a \emph{test charge}%
, but we will call it a mover charge and we will call the $Q_{i}$
environmental charges.

Suppose in our ball of charge, we have an element of charge on the opposite
side of the ball and another element of charge close to us. Would the near
charge element \textquotedblleft screen off\textquotedblright\ or some how
reduce the force due to the far charge element?

Like with gravity, it would not. Note that because one charge is farther
away, the force from the far charge is not the same magnitude as that of the
near charge. But we calculate both using our formula, and add them up (a
vector sum) with all the others.

While we are talking about it, it might seem that the rest of the matter in
the ball will screen off the electric force. But matter, itself, does not
interfere with our electric force. Only other charges will change the force,
and then only following the idea of that their forces add as vectors
(remember that for electricity they can cancel, because we have both
positive and negative charges).

If you took PH123 you will recall that in our study of waves, when we had
two waves in a medium we found we could just added up displacements point
for point. We called this \emph{superposition}. We will use the same word
here, but it has a slightly different meaning. We are not adding up wave
displacements. We are adding up forces. But we still do it point for point.

Now where there are forces, there will be Newton's second law! Let's
consider a problem. Suppose we have three charges, equally spaced apart as
shown where each has the charge of one electron ($q_{e}$) but the middle
charge is positive and the other two are negative%

\begin{equation*}

We only have $x$-components so we can write this as 
\begin{equation*}
F_{net_{x}}=ma=F_{Rx}-F_{Lx}
\end{equation*}%
where the minus sign is used for $F_{Lx}$ because it is pointing to the left
and that is usually the minus $x$ direction.

We may ask, is this mover charge accelerating? We may suspect that the
answer is no, but here we have something new. We don't know the magnitude of 
$F_{R}$ or $F_{L}.$ We now have to find the magnitudes to know. Back in
PH121 you would have been given the magnitude of the forces, but in a charge
problem we know how to calculate the magnitudes, so let's do that. We can
use the formula for the Coulomb force%
\begin{equation*}
F=k_{e}\frac{\left\vert q_{1}\right\vert \left\vert q_{2}\right\vert }{r^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
we can use $r$ as the distance from the middle charge to each of the other
charges since in this special case they are both the same distance from the
middle charge. Then

\begin{equation*}
F_{R}=k_{e}\frac{q_{e}^{2}}{r^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
\begin{equation*}
F_{L}=k_{e}\frac{q_{e}^{2}}{r^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
these are the magnitudes. We should notice that $F_{L}$ points to the left.
So we need to include a minus sign in front of it's magnitude.%
\begin{equation*}
F_{net_{x}}=ma=F_{Rx}-F_{Lx}
\end{equation*}
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{net_{x}} &=&ma=k_{e}\frac{q_{e}^{2}}{r^{2}}-k_{e}\frac{q_{e}^{2}}{r^{2}}
\\
&=&0
\end{eqnarray*}%
now we can say that the middle charge is definitely not accelerating.

Of course this is a pretty easy Newton's 2nd law problem. It was all in the $%
x$-direction. But suppose that is not true. Then we need to take components
of the forces vectors. Let's try one of those.%

our positive charge will cause an upward force. The negative charge to the
right will cause a force that pulls to the right. This is a two-dimensional
problem, so we need to split our Newton's second law into two
one-dimensional problems. 
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{net_{x}} &=&ma_{x}=F_{L} \\
F_{net_{y}} &=&ma_{y}=F_{up}
\end{eqnarray*}%
so%
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{net_{x}} &=&k_{e}\frac{q_{e}^{2}}{r^{2}} \\
F_{net_{y}} &=&k_{e}\frac{q_{e}^{2}}{r^{2}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
We can see that there will be a force in both the $x$ and the $y$ direction.
How do we combine these to get the net force? We use our basic equations for
combining vectors:

\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{net} &=&\sqrt{F_{net_{x}}^{2}+F_{net_{y}}^{2}} \\
&=&\sqrt{\left( k_{e}\frac{q_{e}^{2}}{r^{2}}\right) ^{2}+\left( k_{e}\frac{%
q_{e}^{2}}{r^{2}}\right) ^{2}} \\
&=&\sqrt{2}\frac{1}{r^{2}}k_{e}q_{e}^{2}
\end{eqnarray*}%
but we are not done. We need a direction. Generally we use the angle with
respect to the positive $x$-axis.%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\theta &=&\tan ^{-1}\left( \frac{F_{net_{y}}}{F_{net_{x}}}\right) \\
&=&\tan ^{-1}\left( \frac{k_{e}\frac{q_{e}^{2}}{r^{2}}}{k_{e}\frac{q_{e}^{2}%
}{r^{2}}}\right) \\
&=&\frac{\pi }{4}\unit{rad}
\end{eqnarray*}%
so we have a net force of $F=\sqrt{2}\frac{1}{r^{2}}k_{e}q_{e}^{2}$ at a $45%
\unit{%

Of course, this is still fairly simple, we should also review taking

\theta _{L}=0

and that 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\cos \left( 0\right) &=&1 \\
\sin \left( 0\right) &=&0

so 
\begin{eqnarray*}
ma_{x} &=&F_{L}+F_{2}\cos \theta _{2} \\
ma_{y} &=&0+F_{2}\sin \theta _{2}

This gives the $x$ and $y$ components of the net force on the positive

\section{Fields}

Let's pause for a minute and think of our mover and environmental objects.
We think of the Earth as creating an environment in which the object moves,
feeling the gravitational force. And this is a property of all non-contact
forces.

Recall our falling ball. We considered this as an environment of constant
acceleration. In this environment, the ball feels a force proportional to
their mass%
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}=m\overrightarrow{\mathbf{g}}
\end{equation*}%
where $g=9.81\frac{\unit{m}}{\unit{s}}$ is the acceleration due to gravity.
This is true anywhere near the Earth's surface. We could draw this situation
as follows:

\FRAME{dtbpF}{3.869in}{2.2449in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language
"Scientific Word";type "GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio TRUE;display
"USEDEF";valid_file "T";width 3.869in;height 2.2449in;depth

"1";cropright "1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename
'NAJEKZ00.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}where the environment for
constant acceleration is drawn as a series of arrows in the acceleration
direction (downward toward the center of the Earth). Anywhere the ball goes
the environment is the same. So we draw arrows all around the ball to show
that the whole environment around the ball is the same.

Notice that the environment is described by an acceleration, $g$ given by 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{g}}=\frac{\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}}{m}
\end{equation*}%
that is, the environment is described by the force per unit mass.

We know that this environment is caused by the Earth being there. If the
Earth suddenly disappeared, then the acceleration would just as suddenly go
to zero. So we say that the Earth creates this constant acceleration
environment.

Recall that there are two objects involved, the ball and the Earth. Also
notice that one object creates an environment that the other object moves
in. In our case, the Earth created the environment and the ball moved
through the environment. We called the Earth the \textquotedblleft
Environmental object\textquotedblright , and the ball the \textquotedblleft
mover.\textquotedblright

We know now that something like this happen with our electrical force. The
electric forces is also a non-contact force. So it makes sense to view one
charge as creating an environment in which the other charge moves. But if
there is an environment, what would that environment be. Would it be an
acceleration, or something else?

Michael Faraday came up with answers to this questions. To gain insight into
his answers, let's consider our force again.%
\begin{equation*}
F_{e}=k_{e}\frac{\left\vert Q_{E}\right\vert \left\vert q_{m}\right\vert }{%
r^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
but let's take $q_{m}$ as a very small test charge that we can place near a
larger distribution of charge $Q_{E}.$ This is like the Earth and our small
ball. The large $Q_{E}$ is the environmental charge and the small $q_{m}$ is
the mover charge. 
\begin{equation*}
F_{e}=k_{e}\frac{\left\vert Q_{E}\right\vert \left\vert q_{m}\right\vert }{%
r^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
We want $q_{m}$ to be so small that it can't make any of the parts of $Q_{E}$
rearrange themselves or any of the atoms forming the body that is charged
with $Q_{E}$ to polarize. Then we define a new quantity%
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}=\frac{\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}}{q_{m}}
\end{equation*}%
This is the force per unit charge. This is very like our gravitational
acceleration which is a force per unit mass. Then 
\begin{equation}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}=q_{m}\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}
\end{equation}%
This is really like 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}=m\overrightarrow{\mathbf{g}}
\end{equation*}%
but with the mass replaced by $q_{m}$ and the acceleration replaced by this
new force-per-unit-charge thing. For gravity it is the mass that made the
gravitational pull. With the electric force it is the charge that creates
the pull. So replacing $m$ with $q_{m}$ makes some sense. But what does it
mean that the acceleration has been replaced by $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}%
. $ Well, since $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{g}}$ was the representation of the
environment, can see that this new quantity is taking the place of the
environment, but it can't be an acceleration. It does not have the right
units. Let's investigate what it is.

Let's write the magnitude of $E$ 
\begin{eqnarray*}
E &\mathbf{=}&\frac{F}{q_{m}} \\
&=&\frac{k_{e}\frac{\left\vert Q_{E}\right\vert \left\vert q_{m}\right\vert 
}{r^{2}}}{q_{m}} \\
&=&k_{e}\frac{Q_{E}}{r^{2}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
But this is really not a quantity that we have seen before%

It depends on how far away we are from the environmental charge $Q_{E}.$ It
has a value at every point in space--the whole universe! (think of our
acceleration environment being all around the moving ball) though it's
values for large $r$ are very small. The quantity is only large in the near
vicinity of the charge, $Q_{E}$.\FRAME{dtbpF}{4.3418in}{2.4605in}{0pt}{}{}{%

We can picture this quantity as being like a foot ball field with something
(an environmental charge) hidden out there on the grass. If we know where
the object is, we can tell a searcher how \textquotedblleft
warm\textquotedblright\ or \textquotedblleft cold\textquotedblright\ they
are as they wander around looking for the object. For every location, there
is a value of \textquotedblleft warmness.\textquotedblright\ If we extend
this idea to three dimensions, we are close to a picture of $\overrightarrow{%
\mathbf{E}}\mathbf{.}$ The environment quantity $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}$
has a value at every point in three dimensional space. Since this is a new
quantity, we need to give it a name. We will call it an \emph{electric} 
\emph{field.} 
%TCIMACRO{%

But we have to add one more complication. It is a vector, so it also has a
direction at each point in space as well. This direction is the direction
the force would be on $q_{o},$ the mover, if we placed it at that location.

But where does this field come from? We say that an environmental charge $%
Q_{E}$ creates a field 
\begin{equation}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}=k_{e}\frac{Q_{E}}{r^{2}}\mathbf{\hat{r}}
\end{equation}%
centered at the charge location. The field is our environment for our mover.

Now we can understand more about how gravity works! Have you wondered how a
satellite knows that the Earth is there and that it should be pulled toward
the Earth? The Earth sets up a \emph{gravitational field} because it has
mass. The gravitational field shows up as an acceleration field. The
satellite (the mover) feels the gravitational field because the field exists
at the location of the satellite (it exists at all locations, so it exists
at the satellite's location).%

The satellite does not have to know that the Earth is there, because it
feels the field right where it is. The satellite reacts to the field, not
the Earth that created the field.\footnote{%
Here I\ am taking a quantum mechanical view of gravity. In General
Relativity, the \textquotedblleft field\textquotedblright\ is space that is
warped by the mass of the Earth.}

Likewise, our charge $Q_{E}$ has the property of creating an \emph{electric
field} as the environment around it. Other charges (movers) will feel the
field at their locations, and therefore will feel a force due to the field
created by $Q_{E}.$

\section{Field Lines}

We need a way to draw the environment created by the environmental charge $%
Q_{E}.$ We could draw lots of arrows like in the previous pictures. and we
will do this sometimes. But there is another way to draw the environment
that has become traditional. Have you ever taken iron filings and placed a
magnet near them? If you do, you will notice that the filings seem to line
up.%

If you took PH121 you probably heard that there is a magnetic force. It is a
non-contact force, so we expect it has a \emph{magnetic field}. The iron
filings are aligning because they are acted upon by the field. It is natural
to represent this field as a series of lines like the ones formed by the
iron filings. We will do this in a few lectures!

But there is a similar experiment we can do with the electric force. This is
harder, but we can use small seeds or pieces of thread suspended in oil.
These small things become polarized in an electric field. They line up like

We can't tell if the charge was negative or positive from oil suspension

coming out of the charge. If it were negative the field lines would be drawn
as going in to the charge. Here is a combination of a negative and a
positive charge or dipole. \FRAME{dhFU}{2.789in}{1.721in}{0pt}{\Qcb{%

lines is proportional to the field, but there is no set proportionality. If
the field from one charge is twice that of the other, we pick a number of
field lines for, say, the negative charge, and double the lines on the
larger positive charge.

This gives us a way to picture the electric field in our minds!

Some things to notice:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The lines begin on positive charges

\item The lines end on negative charges

\item If you don't have matching charges, the lines end infinitely far away
(like the single charges in the first picture).

\item Larger charges have more lines coming from them

\item Field lines cannot cross each other%

\end{enumerate}

We only draw the field lines for the environmental charges. Of course the
mover charge also makes a field, but this self-field can't cause the mover
charge to move. If it could we could have perpetual motion and that violates
the second law of thermodynamics. Since the mover's self-field is not
participating in making the motion, we won't take the time to draw it!%
\footnote{%
This picture will be a little more complicated when we allow for
relativistic motion of charges and other more difficult effects, but that
can wait for more advanced physics courses. For most engineering
applications, this is a great approximation.}

Remember, field lines are not real, but are a nice way to draw the field
made by the environmental charge. We will use field lines often in drawing
pictures as part of our problem solving process.

\end{itemize}

\section{Standard Charge Configurations}

Actual engineering projects or experimental designs require detailed
calculations of fields using computers. These field simulations use powerful
numerical techniques that are beyond this sophomore class. But we can gain
some great insight by using some basic models of simple charged objects. We
will often look at the following models:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{tabular}{|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Standard Configurations of Charge} \\ \hline
Point charge \\ \hline
Several point charges \\ \hline
Line of Charge \\ \hline
Semi-infinite sheet of charge \\ \hline
Charged sphere \\ \hline
Charged spherical shell \\ \hline
Ring of Charge \\ \hline
\end{tabular}%
\end{equation*}

\section{Point Charges}

We have already met one of these standard configurations, the point charge%
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{q_{E}}{r^{2}}%
\mathbf{\hat{r}}
\end{equation*}%
The field of the point charge is represented below\FRAME{dhF}{2.4171in}{%

'N8ESC725.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}This picture requires a little
explanation. The arrows are larger nearer the charge to show that the field
is stronger. But note that each arrow is the magnitude and direction of the
charge at one point. We really need a three dimensional picture to describe
this, and even then the fact that the arrows have length can be misleading.
The long arrows cover up other points, that should also have arrows. We can
only draw the field at a few points, and at those points the field has both
magnitude and direction. But we must remember that there is really a field
magnitude and direction at every point.

The extension is a group of point charges%
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}=\sum_{i}\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}_{i}
\end{equation*}

were we recognize that we are summing vectors. Let's take a look at a few
combinations of charges and find their fields

\subsection{Two charges}

Let's go back to our idea of an environmental charge, $Q_{E},$ and a mover
charge, $q_{m}$. The mover charge is considered to be small enough that its
effect on $Q_{E}$ is negligible. So the field due to the large charge is
unaffected by this small charge.

Of course, the total field is a superposition of both fields. But recall
that the mover's self-field can't move the mover. So we don't draw the field
due to $q_{m}$. We we can envision an environmental field that is just due
to the environmental charge, $Q_{E},$ as if there are no other charges any
where in the whole universe. Of course this is not the case, but this is how
we think of the field \emph{due to} charge $Q_{E}.$%
%TCIMACRO{%

We can identify that a charge $q_{m}$ placed in this field due to $Q_{E}$
will feel a force 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{e} &\mathbf{=}&q_{m}\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}
\\
&=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{Q_{E}q_{m}}{r^{2}}\mathbf{\hat{r}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
due to the field 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{Q_{E}}{r^{2}}%
\mathbf{\hat{r}}
\end{equation*}%
where this field is just due to $Q_{E}$ and does not contain the
contribution from $q_{m}.$ So the charge $q_{m}$ only feels a force due to
the field created by charge $Q_{E}.$ A third charge, $q_{new}$ brought close
to the other two would feel both $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}_{Q}$ and $%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}_{q}.$ Then both $Q_{E}$ and our original $q_{m}$
would be environmental charges and the new charge $q_{new}$ would be the
mover. At this point, we would probably relabel $Q_{E}$ and $q_{m}$ as $%
Q_{1} $ and $Q_{2}$ and relabel $q_{new}$ as $q_{m}$ so we could tell that
the original two charges are now the environment and the new charge is the
mover.

Remember that the field is a force per unit charge. Forces add as vectors,
so we should expect fields to add as vectors too. Let's do a problem.\FRAME{%

Two charges are separated by a distance $d.$ What is the field a distance $L$
from the center of the two charges?

We should recognize this as our old friend, the dipole.

Note that both of these charges are environmental charges. We are asked in
this problem to find the environment, the field. We don't really have a
mover charge. But we could pretend we do have a mover, $q_{o}$ at point $P$
where we want to know the environment if it helps us picture the situation.
But really we are calculating what the environment around the two charges
will be.

We start by drawing the situation. I\ chose not to draw field lines. Instead
I drew the field vectors at the point, $P,$ where we want the field. The
field lines would tell me about the whole environment everywhere, and that
might be useful. But this problem only wants to know the field at one point, 
$P.$ So it was less work to draw the field using vectors at our one point.%

The net environment is the superposition of the fields due to each of the
environmental charges. 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}_{net}=\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}_{1}+%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}_{3}
\end{equation*}

From the figure, we see that if we had a small mover charge, $q_{o}$ on the
axis a distance at point $p$ then we would get two forces, one from each of
the environmental charges $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$. We can use Newton's second
law to find the net force on our imaginary $q_{o}.$ Of course, since this is
a two-dimensional problem we will split it into two one-dimensional
problems. 
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{net_{z}} &=&ma_{z}=-F_{1}\cos \theta +F_{2}\cos \theta \\
F_{net_{y}} &=&ma_{y}=F_{1}\sin \theta +F_{2}\sin \theta
\end{eqnarray*}%
we can see that the distance from each charge to point $P$ is 
\begin{equation*}
r=\sqrt{\frac{d^{2}}{4}+L^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
so%
\begin{equation*}
\sin \theta =\frac{d}{2\sqrt{\frac{d^{2}}{4}+L^{2}}}
\end{equation*}%
we also know from Coulomb's law that 
\begin{equation*}
F_{1}=F_{2}=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{qq_{o}}{r^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
but we want the field, so we need to divide all of this by $q_{o}$%
\begin{equation*}
E_{1}=E_{2}=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{q}{r^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
Our Newton's second law becomes an equation for the components of the
combined electric field.%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{F_{net_{z}}}{q_{o}} &=&-\frac{F_{1}}{q_{o}}\cos \theta +\frac{F_{2}}{%
q_{o}}\cos \theta \\
\frac{F_{net_{y}}}{q_{o}} &=&\frac{F_{1}}{q_{o}}\sin \theta +\frac{F_{2}}{%
q_{o}}\sin \theta
\end{eqnarray*}%
or just%
\begin{eqnarray*}
E_{net_{z}} &=&-E_{1}\cos \theta +E_{2}\cos \theta \\
E_{net_{y}} &=&E_{1}\sin \theta +E_{2}\sin \theta
\end{eqnarray*}%
We can see from the figure that in the $x$-direction we will have no net
field, 
\begin{equation*}
E_{z}=-E_{1}\cos \left( \theta \right) +E_{1}\cos \theta =0
\end{equation*}%
But in the $y$-direction we have%
\begin{eqnarray*}
E_{y} &=&E_{1}\sin \theta +E_{2}\sin \theta \\
&=&2E_{1}\sin \theta \\
&=&\frac{2}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{q}{r^{2}}\sin \theta
\end{eqnarray*}%
and since we found that 
\begin{equation*}
\sin \theta =\frac{d}{2\sqrt{\frac{d^{2}}{4}+L^{2}}}
\end{equation*}%
we can write our field as%
\begin{eqnarray*}
E_{y} &=&\frac{2}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{q}{\frac{d^{2}}{4}+L^{2}}\frac{d}{%
2\sqrt{\frac{d^{2}}{4}+L^{2}}} \\
&=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{qd}{\left( \frac{d^{2}}{4}+L^{2}\right)
^{\frac{3}{2}}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
This is our total field at the distance $L$ away on the axis. This is the
environment that a mover charge could move through.

Note that we pretended that we had a mover, $q_{o}$, but in finding the
field the $q_{o}$ canceled out, so indeed we are left with just the
environment in our calculation, we just have the field.

Now suppose our mover charge is very far away. That is, suppose we make $L$
very large. So large that $L\gg d$ then 
\begin{equation*}
\underset{L\gg d}{\lim }\frac{1}{\left( \frac{d^{2}}{4}+L^{2}\right) ^{\frac{%
3}{2}}}=\frac{1}{L^{3}}
\end{equation*}%
Then our field becomes%
\begin{eqnarray*}
E &=&E_{y}=\frac{2}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{qd}{\left( \frac{d^{2}}{4}%
+L^{2}\right) ^{\frac{3}{2}}} \\
&=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{qd}{L^{3}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
Since many charged particles are small, like atoms or molecules, this limit
is often useful.

Now suppose we repeat the calculation, but this time we chose a point that
is $L$ away, but that is on the $y$-axis above the charges, we would find%
\begin{equation*}
E=E_{y}=\frac{2}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{qd}{L^{3}}

(solid green line) falls off much faster than a point charge field (dashed
red line). This makes sense because the farther away we get, the more it
looks like the two charges are right next to each other, and since they are
opposite in sign, they are essentially neutral when viewed together from far
away. We can see why atoms don't exhibit a significant charge forces at
normal distances.

This arrangement of charges we already know as a dipole. We are treating the
two charges as a unit making the environment that other charges might move
in. Since we are treating the two charges as one unit, it is customary to
define a quantity 
\begin{equation*}
p=qd
\end{equation*}%
and to make this a vector by defining the direction of $p$ to be from the
negative to the positive charge along the axis.\FRAME{dhF}{0.8536in}{0.9478in%

field as

\end{equation*}%
We could also treat this dipole as a complicated mover charge in some other
environmental field!. Then this quantity $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{p}}$ will
help us understand how a dipole will move when placed in an environmental
electric field. For example, we know that water molecules are dipoles. A
microwave oven creates a strong environmental electric field that makes the
water molecules rotate. When we studied rotational motion we found a
mass-like term that helped us to know how difficult something was to make
rotate. That was the moment of inertia. This dipole term, $\overrightarrow{%
\mathbf{p}},$ will tell us how likely a dipole is to spin, so we will call $%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{p}}$ the \emph{dipole moment}.

We are working our way toward many charges that will require using
integration to sum up the contributions to the field. But let's make this
transition slowly. Next let's add just one more environmental charge, for a
total of three.

Let's just start with the fields this time. From our picture, we expect in
this case to have only $z$-components. Since all the charges are the same
sign, \FRAME{dtbpF}{4.2735in}{3.3324in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

\end{equation*}%
and observing the triangles formed and remembering our trigonometry, we have 
\begin{equation*}
\cos \theta =\frac{L}{\sqrt{d^{2}+L^{2}}}
\end{equation*}%
so%
\begin{eqnarray*}
E_{z} &=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{q}{d^{2}+L^{2}}\frac{L}{\sqrt{%
d^{2}+L^{2}}} \\
&&+\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{q}{L^{2}} \\
&&+\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{q}{d^{2}+L^{2}}\frac{L}{\sqrt{%
d^{2}+L^{2}}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
or%
\begin{equation*}
E_{z}=\frac{q}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\left( \frac{2L}{\left( d^{2}+L^{2}\right)
^{\frac{3}{2}}}+\frac{1}{L^{2}}\right)
\end{equation*}%
This is our answer.

Once again let's consider the limit $L\gg d.$ If our answer is right, when
we get very far from the group of charges they should look like a single
charge with the amount of charge being the sum of all three environmental
charges. In this limit 
\begin{equation*}
\underset{L\gg d}{\lim }\frac{1}{\left( d^{2}+L^{2}\right) ^{\frac{3}{2}}}=%
\frac{1}{L^{3}}
\end{equation*}%
so%
\begin{eqnarray*}
E_{z} &\approx &\frac{q}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\left( \frac{2L}{L^{3}}+\frac{1}{%
L^{2}}\right) \\
&=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\left( \frac{3q}{L^{2}}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}%
so on the central axis%
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\approx \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\left( \frac{%
3q}{L^{2}}\right) \mathbf{\hat{k}}
\end{equation*}%
And indeed, this is very like one charge that is three times as large as our
actual charges if we get far enough away.

This shows us a pattern we will often see. Far away, our field looks like
what we would expect if the net charge were all congregated in a point. Near
the charges, we must calculate the superposition of the fields. But far away
we can treat the distribution as a point charge. This is very like what we
did with mass in PH121 or Dynamics. We could often treat masses as point
masses at the center of mass, if the distances involved were larger than the
mass sizes.%

\section{Combinations of many charges}

We have found the field from a point charge.%
\begin{equation}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{q_{E}}{r^{2}}%
\mathbf{\hat{r}}
\end{equation}%
where the field is in the same direction as $\hat{r}$ if the charge is
positive, and in the opposite direction if the charge is negative (think of
our field lines, they go toward the negative charge). This will become one
of a group of standard charge configurations that we will use to gain a
mental picture of complex configurations of charge. We have done this
already for combinations of point charges. We can combine the point charge
fields to get the total field.

The other standard models are combinations of many, many charges.

\subsection{Line of Charge}

Another is an infinitely long line of charge, or a infinite charged wire.
Since this long line of charge is infinite, it must have an infinite amount
of charge. But we can describe \textquotedblleft how much\textquotedblright\
charge it has with a linear charge density%
\begin{equation*}
\lambda =\frac{Q}{L}
\end{equation*}%

\subsection{Semi-infinite sheet of charge}

A sheet or plane of charge,usually a semi-infinite sheet of charge is also
useful\FRAME{dhF}{3.851in}{1.6942in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

having infinite charge, but if we define an amount of charge per unit area%
\begin{equation*}
\eta =\frac{Q}{A}
\end{equation*}%
we can compare sheets that are more charge rich than others.

\subsection{Sphere of charge}

Finally, we have drawn a sphere of charge already\FRAME{dhF}{1.8031in}{%
1.5489in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language "Scientific Word";type

We can define an amount of charge per unit volume to help describe this
distribution%
\begin{equation*}
\rho =\frac{Q}{V}
\end{equation*}%
The spherical shell of charge is related to a sheet of charge, so we will
include it here\FRAME{dhF}{1.6215in}{1.4927in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special%

drawn in cross section like the others. From your calculus experience you
can guess that a spherical shell of charge with a certain volume charge
density might be useful in integration, but we also can easily produce such
a configuration of charge by charging a round balloon or a spherical
conductor.

The ring of charge is similar to the spherical shell, but is also much like
the line of charge.

In our next lecture, we will take on the job of finding the fields that
result from these last few charge configurations except the spherical shell,
which will have to wait a few lectures.

Suppose we have a continuous distribution of charge with some mover charge $%
q_{m}$ fairly far away. You might ask, how do we get a continuous
distribution of charge? After all, charge seems to be quantized. Well, if we
have a collection of charges where the distances between the individual
charge carriers are much smaller that the distance from the whole collection
of charges to some point where we want to measure the field (where the mover
charge might be), then in our field calculations at this distant point we
can model the charge distribution causing the field as continuous. As an
analogy, think of your computer screen. It is really a collection of dots of
light. But if we are a few feet away, we see a continuous picture. We can
treat the dots as though there were no space in between them. For our
continuous charge model, it is the same. We are supposing we are observing
from far enough away that we won't notice the effects of the charges being
separated by small distances.

We should remember, though, that this is a macroscopic view. At some point
it must break down, since charge is carried in discrete amounts. If we want
the field very close to a distribution of charges, we must treat our charge
distribution as a collection of individual charges like we did in the last
lecture. Notice in our last lecture that we found that the field infinitely
far from the charges was always zero. That is too far away for our
continuous charge model to be useful. But if we went far enough away--but
not too far, the three charge configuration looked like a point charge with
a total charge that was the sum of the individual charges. At such
distances, the separation between the charges become unimportant. This is
the sort of large distance we are talking about in our continuous charge
distribution model.

To find the field due to a continuous charge distribution, we break up the
charged object into small pieces in a calculus sense. Each small piece is
still a continuous distribution of charge. It will have an amount of charge $%
\Delta q_{E},$ where here the $\Delta $ means \textquotedblleft a small
amount of.\textquotedblright\ Then we calculate the field due to this
element of charge. We repeat the process for each element using the
superposition principle to sum up all the individual field contributions.
This is very like our method of finding the field from individual charges,
only instead of a sum we want to let $\Delta q_{E}$ becomes very small and
use an integral. The field due to this bit of charge is%
\begin{equation*}
\Delta \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{\Delta
q_{E}}{r^{2}}\mathbf{\hat{r}}
\end{equation*}%
Recall that here $\Delta $ means \textquotedblleft a small bit
of\textquotedblright\ and is not a difference between two charge values or
two field values. We learned that we can sum up the fields from each piece%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}} &\approx &\sum_{i}\Delta \overrightarrow{\mathbf{%
E}}_{i} \\
&\mathbf{\approx }&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\dsum\limits_{i}\frac{\Delta
q_{i}}{r_{i}^{2}}\mathbf{\hat{r}}_{i}
\end{eqnarray*}%
and now we use our M215 (or M113) tricks to convert this into an integral.
We let our small element of charge become very small (but not so small that
we violate our assumption that the charge distribution of $\Delta q_{E}$ is
continuous).%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}} &\mathbf{=}&\lim_{\Delta q_{i}\rightarrow 0}%
\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\dsum\limits_{i}\frac{\Delta q_{i}}{r_{i}^{2}}%
\mathbf{\hat{r}}_{i} \\
&=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\int \frac{dq_{E}}{r^{2}}\mathbf{\hat{r}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
The limits of the integration must include the entire distribution of charge
if we want the total field. This will be our basic equation for finding the
field for continuous distributions of charge.

Let's do some examples.

Let's try this for a line of charge. This may seem like a simple charge
configuration, but this problem is really quite challenging. Let's say that
the charge is evenly distributed along the line. Then we can use the linear
charge density 
\begin{equation*}
\lambda =Q/L
\end{equation*}%
to find $dq.$ The quantity $Q$ is the total amount of charge on the wire and 
$L$ is the length of the wire. Then%
\begin{equation*}
dq=\lambda dy
\end{equation*}

Of course, we may not always have a constant density, then we need to have
and element of charge that varies with position. For a line charge, we would
have 
\begin{equation*}
dq=\lambda \left( y\right) dy
\end{equation*}%
but for now, let's assume the linear charge density is constant. Our basic
formula tells us that we should add up all the $dq$ elements. But we have an
obstacle. We need a different $\mathbf{\hat{r}}_{i}$ for every $dq_{i}.$ How
do we deal with this?

Just like with last lecture, we only need the component of the part of the
field that does not cancel. Here we need to have drawn a good picture. From
our drawing we can tell that, in this case, only the $z$ component will
survive (the $y$-components cancel). So we only need to find%
\begin{equation*}
E_{z}=\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot \mathbf{\hat{k}}
\end{equation*}%
This is a good thing, because our basic equation has an $\mathbf{\hat{r}}$
in it 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\int \frac{dq}{r^{2}}%
\mathbf{\hat{r}}
\end{equation*}%
and we don't know how to do this integral including the $\mathbf{\hat{r}.}$
As always we will take this two-dimeinsional problem and split it into two
one-dimensional problems before we can proceed. We will split our problem
into $z$ and $y$-components. But since we know that only the the $z$%
-component will survive, we can just calculate the $z$-component, 
\begin{eqnarray*}
E_{z} &=&\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot \mathbf{\hat{k}} \\
&=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\int_{-L/2}^{L/2}\frac{dq}{r^{2}}\mathbf{\hat{%
r}}\cdot \mathbf{\hat{k}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
and we recognize 
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{\hat{r}}\cdot \mathbf{\hat{k}}=\cos \theta
\end{equation*}%
So we are left with just%
\begin{equation*}
E_{z}=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\int_{-L/2}^{L/2}\frac{dq}{r^{2}}\cos
\theta
\end{equation*}%
which is much more likely be be integrable with what we know from M113 or
M215.

Like in our last lecture, we will want to express%
\begin{equation*}
r=\sqrt{y^{2}+z^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
and it makes it easier if we write 
\begin{equation*}
\cos \theta =\frac{z}{\sqrt{y^{2}+z^{2}}}
\end{equation*}%
Then our integral can be written as 
\begin{eqnarray*}
E_{z} &=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\int_{-L/2}^{L/2}\frac{\lambda dy}{%
y^{2}+z^{2}}\frac{z}{\sqrt{y^{2}+z^{2}}} \\
&=&\frac{\lambda z}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\int_{-L/2}^{L/2}\frac{dy}{\left(
y^{2}+z^{2}\right) ^{\frac{3}{2}}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
This now looks like a M215 or M113 problem. We can find this integral in an
integral table or you can use your calculator, or a symbolic math package,
or you can remember your M215 or M113 and prove that 
\begin{equation*}
\int_{-L/2}^{L/2}\frac{dx}{\left( x^{2}\pm a^{2}\right) ^{\frac{3}{2}}}=%
\frac{\pm x}{a^{2}\sqrt{x^{2}\pm a^{2}}}
\end{equation*}%
so%
\begin{eqnarray*}
E_{z} &=&\frac{\lambda z}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\int_{-L/2}^{L/2}\frac{dy}{%
\left( y^{2}+z^{2}\right) ^{\frac{3}{2}}} \\
&=&\frac{\lambda z}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\left[ \frac{y}{z^{2}\sqrt{y^{2}+z^{2}%
}}\right\vert _{-L/2}^{L/2} \\
&=&\frac{\lambda z}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\left[ \frac{L/2}{z^{2}\sqrt{\left(
L/2\right) ^{2}+z^{2}}}-\frac{-L/2}{z^{2}\sqrt{\left( -L/2\right) ^{2}+z^{2}}%
}\right] \\
&=&\frac{\lambda }{4\pi z\epsilon _{o}}\frac{L}{\sqrt{\left( L/2\right)
^{2}+z^{2}}} \\
&=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{Q}{z\sqrt{\left( \frac{L}{2}\right)
^{2}+z^{2}}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
This is the field due to a charged rod of length $L.$

Note that there are only a few integrals that we can solve in closed form to
find electric fields. It might be a good idea to build your own integral
table for our exams, including the integrals from the problems and examples
we work.

An infinitely long line of charge is one of our basic charge models. So far
our line of charge is not infinitely long. We can find the field due to an
infinite line of charge by letting $L\ $become large 
\begin{eqnarray*}
E_{z} &=&\underset{L\rightarrow \infty }{\lim }\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}%
\frac{Q}{z\sqrt{\left( \frac{L}{2}\right) ^{2}+z^{2}}} \\
&=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{Q}{z\left( \frac{L}{2}\right) } \\
&=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{2\lambda }{z} \\
&=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{2\lambda }{z}
\end{eqnarray*}%
or if we use $r$ now in place of $z$ to define the distance from the center
of the line of charge (so it is easier to compare to our point charge
formula), we have%
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}_{z}=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{2\lambda }{%
r}\mathbf{\hat{k}}

charge only depends on the distance away from the line, and on the linear
charge density. As we would expect, the field gets weaker as we get farther
away. But it does not get weaker as fast as the point charge case. That
makes some sense, because our infinite line of charge is, well, really big.
You are never really too far away from something that is infinitely big. So
we should not expect such a charge configuration to look very like a point
charge no matter how far away we go. Of course and infinite line of charge
is not something we can really build. So this is a useful approximation
near, say, a charged wire. But farther from the wire the approximation would
not be so good and we would have to go back to our finite line solution.

Using what we have learned from the line of charge, we can find the axial
field of a ring of charge. Again, our picture is critically important. We
will need to solve the problem of eliminating $\mathbf{\hat{r}.}$ From the
picture, we can see that we will only have an $z$-component again. So we can
eliminate $\mathbf{\hat{r}}$ the same way as in the last problem.

We model the ring as a line of charge of length $2\pi R$ that has been bent
into a circle. Again we have the basic equation%
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\int \frac{dq}{r^{2}}%
\mathbf{\hat{r}}
\end{equation*}%
Since the ring of charge is like a line of charge bent into a hoop. So we
can plan to work this problem very like the the line charge. Start again with%
\begin{equation*}
dq=\lambda dy
\end{equation*}%
but now we know that for the hoop 
\begin{equation*}
dq=\lambda ds
\end{equation*}%
where $s$ is the arc length. Recall that 
\begin{eqnarray*}
s &=&R\phi \\
ds &=&Rd\phi
\end{eqnarray*}%
where $R$ is the radius of the ring and $\phi $ is an angle measured from
the $x$-axis. So our $dq$ expression becomes 
\begin{equation*}
dq=\lambda Rd\phi
\end{equation*}%
For the whole ring 
\begin{eqnarray*}
Q &=&\lambda R2\pi \\
&=&2\pi R\lambda
\end{eqnarray*}%
We also need to use geometry to find $r,$ the distance to our point were we
want to know the field.%
\begin{equation*}
r=\sqrt{y_{i}^{2}+z^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
but since this is a ring, our $y_{i}=R$ for all $i.$ So%
\begin{equation*}
r=\sqrt{R^{2}+z^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
and using the same reasoning as in our last problem, 
\begin{equation*}
\cos \theta =\frac{z}{\sqrt{R^{2}+z^{2}}}
\end{equation*}%
We need to split our three-dimensional problem into three one-dimensional
problems. We will split our vector equation into $x,$ $y,$ and $z$
components. But once more, we know from symmetry that only the $z$-component
will not be zero. Then we can set up our integral.%
\begin{eqnarray*}
E_{z} &=&\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot \mathbf{\hat{k}} \\
&=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\int_{-L/2}^{L/2}\frac{dq}{r^{2}}\mathbf{\hat{%
r}}\cdot \mathbf{\hat{k}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
Putting in all the parts we have found yields%
\begin{eqnarray*}
E_{z} &=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\int \frac{dq}{R^{2}+z^{2}}\frac{z}{%
\sqrt{R^{2}+z^{2}}} \\
&=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\int \frac{z\lambda Rd\phi }{\left(
R^{2}+z^{2}\right) ^{\frac{3}{2}}} \\
&=&\frac{z\lambda R}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}\left( R^{2}+z^{2}\right) ^{\frac{3}{2%
}}}\int_{0}^{2\pi }d\phi
\end{eqnarray*}%
This is an easy integral to do! and we see that the axial field is%
\begin{equation*}
E_{z}=\frac{z2\pi R\lambda }{4\pi \epsilon _{o}\left( R^{2}+z^{2}\right) ^{%
\frac{3}{2}}}
\end{equation*}%
or, using our form for $Q$ 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{zQ}{\left(
R^{2}+z^{2}\right) ^{\frac{3}{2}}}\mathbf{\hat{k}}
\end{equation*}

Once again we should check to see if this is a reasonable result. If we take
the limit as $z$ goes to infinity, we get zero. That is comforting. But if
we just let $z$ be much larger than $R,$ but not too big%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\underset{z\gg R}{\lim }\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}} &=&\underset{z\gg R}{%
\lim }\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{zQ}{\left( R^{2}+z^{2}\right) ^{%
\frac{3}{2}}}\mathbf{\hat{k}} \\
&=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{zQ}{\left( z^{2}\right) ^{\frac{3}{2}}}%
\mathbf{\hat{k}} \\
&=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{zQ}{z^{3}}\mathbf{\hat{k}} \\
&=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{Q}{z^{2}}\mathbf{\hat{k}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
we again have a point charge field with total charge $Q.$ Since a ring of
charge should look like a point charge if we get far enough away, this is
reasonable.

We have worked two problems for continuous charge distributions. The pattern
for solving both problems was the same. And we will follow the same pattern
for solving for the field from continuous charge distributions in all our
problems:

\begin{itemize}
\item Start with $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}%
\int \frac{dq_{E}}{r^{2}}\mathbf{\hat{r}}$

\item Find an expression for $dq_{E}$

\item Use geometry to find an expression for $r,$ the distance from $dq_{E}$
to the point, $P,$ where we want to know the field.

\item Eliminate $\mathbf{\hat{r}}$ in the usual way by turning a two or
three-dimensional problem into two or three one-dimensional problems (using
vector components, etc.)

\item Solve the integral(s) (don't forget to report the direction)
\end{itemize}

If you have a harder problem, one where you need the field from a continuous
charge distribution at a point that is not on an axis, or your problem has
little symmetry, you can go back to 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}} &\approx &\sum_{i}\Delta \overrightarrow{\mathbf{%
E}}_{i} \\
&\mathbf{\approx }&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\dsum\limits_{i}\frac{\Delta
q_{i}}{r_{i}^{2}}\mathbf{\hat{r}}_{i}
\end{eqnarray*}%
and perform the sum numerically. We won't do this in our class, but you
might in practice or in a higher level electrodynamics course.

Let's try a two dimensional distribution of charge, a uniform flat sheet of
charge. We will assume that the sheet is infinitely large (so we don't have
to deal with what happens at the edges). Let's call the surface charge
density $\eta =Q/A$ where $Q$ is the total charge and $A$ is the total area.
Of course, we can't calculate this surface charge density directly from the
totals, because they are infinite. But we could take a square meter of area
and find the amount of charge in that small area. The ratio should be the
same for any area so long as $\eta $ is uniform. We will find the electric
field to the right of the sheet at point $P$.

Once again we start with%
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\int \frac{dq}{r^{2}}%
\mathbf{\hat{r}}
\end{equation*}%
We need to find $dq,$ an expression for $r,$ and get rid of $\hat{r}$

Since the disk is uniformly charged, then, knowing the surface charge
density 
\begin{equation*}
\eta =\frac{Q}{A}
\end{equation*}%
we can find the total amount of charge for an area 
\begin{equation*}
Q=\eta A
\end{equation*}%
so 
\begin{equation*}
dq=\eta dA
\end{equation*}%
but what area, $dA$, should we use? Notice the green patch in the figure
that is marked $dA$. Think for a moment about arc length%
\begin{equation*}
s=R\phi
\end{equation*}%
This little area is about $ds=Rd\phi $ long, and about $dR$ wide. If we let $%
dA$ be small enough, this is exact. So%
\begin{equation*}
dA=Rd\phi dR
\end{equation*}
Then our $dq$ is just $\eta $ times this 
\begin{equation*}
dq=\eta Rd\phi dR
\end{equation*}

From geometry we identify%
\begin{equation*}
r=\sqrt{z^{2}+R^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
and, due to symmetry we expect only the $z$-component of the field to
survive. So to get rid of $\hat{r}$ we multiply (dot product) by $\hat{k}.$
There will be an angle, $\theta ,$ between $\hat{r}$ and $\hat{k}.$ So we
expect the result of the dot product to be that we multiply by the cosine of 
$\theta $%
\begin{equation*}
\cos \theta =\frac{z}{\sqrt{z^{2}+R^{2}}}
\end{equation*}

We want to put all this into our basic equation. This time the radius $R$
changes, so let's call it $R^{\prime }$ so we recognize that it is a
variable over which we must integrate. We s;lit our integral equation into
components, so 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\int \frac{dq}{r^{2}}%
\mathbf{\hat{r}}
\end{equation*}%
becomes%
\begin{eqnarray*}
E_{x} &=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\int \frac{\eta Rd\phi dR^{\prime }}{%
\left( z^{2}+R^{\prime 2}\right) }\mathbf{\hat{r}}\cdot \mathbf{\hat{\imath}}
\\
E_{y} &=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\int \frac{\eta Rd\phi dR^{\prime }}{%
\left( z^{2}+R^{\prime 2}\right) }\mathbf{\hat{r}}\cdot \mathbf{\hat{\jmath}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
and 
\begin{eqnarray*}
E_{z} &=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\int \frac{\eta Rd\phi dR^{\prime }}{%
\left( z^{2}+R^{\prime 2}\right) }\mathbf{\hat{r}}\cdot \mathbf{\hat{k}} \\
&=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\int \frac{\eta Rd\phi dR^{\prime }}{\left(
z^{2}+R^{\prime 2}\right) }\cos \theta
\end{eqnarray*}%
and we will integrate from $R^{\prime }=0$ to $R^{\prime }=R.$

Note that from our symmatry we cab argue that $E_{x}$ and $E_{y}$ must be
zero, so we only need to calculate 
\begin{equation*}
E_{z}=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\int_{0}^{2\pi }\int_{0}^{R}\frac{z\eta
R^{\prime }d\phi dR^{\prime }}{\left( z^{2}+R^{\prime 2}\right) ^{\frac{3}{2}%
}}
\end{equation*}%
Performing the integration over $d\phi $ just gives us a factor of $2\pi $%
\begin{equation*}
E_{z}=\frac{z\pi \eta }{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\int_{0}^{R}\frac{2R^{\prime
}dR^{\prime }}{\left( z^{2}+R^{\prime 2}\right) ^{\frac{3}{2}}}
\end{equation*}%
where, for convenience, we have left the $2$ inside the integral (it will be
useful later).

We need to solve this integral. A $u$-substitution is one way. Suppose we
let 
\begin{equation*}
u=z^{2}+R^{\prime 2}
\end{equation*}%
so%
\begin{equation*}
du=2R^{\prime }dR^{\prime }
\end{equation*}

We will need to adjust the limits of integration, for $R^{\prime }=0$ we
have 
\begin{equation*}
u=z^{2}
\end{equation*}%
and for $R^{\prime }=R$%
\begin{equation*}
u=z^{2}+R^{2}
\end{equation*}%
then our integral becomes%
\begin{equation*}
E_{z}=\frac{z\pi \eta }{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\int_{z^{2}}^{z^{2}+R^{2}}\frac{du%
}{\left( u\right) ^{\frac{3}{2}}}
\end{equation*}%
We get%
\begin{eqnarray*}
E_{z} &=&\frac{z\pi \eta }{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\left[ \frac{-2}{\left(
u\right) ^{\frac{1}{2}}}\right\vert _{z^{2}}^{z^{2}+R^{2}} \\
&=&\frac{z\pi \eta }{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\left( \frac{-2}{\left(
z^{2}+R^{2}\right) ^{\frac{1}{2}}}-\frac{-2}{\left( z^{2}\right) ^{\frac{1}{2%
}}}\right) \\
&=&\frac{-2z\pi \eta }{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\left( \frac{1}{\left(
z^{2}+R^{2}\right) ^{\frac{1}{2}}}-\frac{1}{z}\right) \\
&=&\frac{-2\pi \eta }{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\left( \frac{z}{\left(
z^{2}+R^{2}\right) ^{\frac{1}{2}}}-1\right) \\
&=&\frac{-2\pi \eta }{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\left( \frac{1}{\frac{1}{z}\left(
z^{2}+R^{2}\right) ^{\frac{1}{2}}}-1\right)
\end{eqnarray*}%
The result is 
\begin{equation*}
E_{z}=\frac{2\pi \eta }{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\left( 1-\frac{1}{\left( 1+\frac{%
R^{2}}{z^{2}}\right) ^{\frac{1}{2}}}\right)
\end{equation*}%
or%
\begin{equation*}
E_{z}=\frac{2\pi \eta }{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\left( 1-\left( 1+\frac{R^{2}}{%
z^{2}}\right) ^{-\frac{1}{2}}\right)
\end{equation*}%
This looks messy, but this is the answer.

But wait, this is really a disk of charge with radius $R.$ We wanted an
infinite sheet of charge. So. suppose we let $R$ get very big. Then

\begin{eqnarray*}
E_{R\rightarrow \infty } &=&\underset{R\rightarrow \infty }{\lim }\frac{2\pi
\eta }{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\left( 1-\left( 1+\frac{R^{2}}{z^{2}}\right) ^{-%
\frac{1}{2}}\right) \\
&=&\frac{2\pi \eta }{4\pi \epsilon _{o}} \\
&=&\frac{\eta }{2\epsilon _{o}}

This is the field for our semi-infinite sheet of charge.

We should take some time to figure out if this makes sense.

This sheet cuts the entire universe into to two parts. It is so big, that it
is hard to say anything is very far away from it. So we can understand this
answer, The field from such a sheet of charge is constant every where in all
of space. No matter how far away we get, it will never look like a point
charge, in fact, it never really looks any farther away!

Note we did just one side of the sheet, there is a matching field on the
other side. So this sheet of charge fills all of space with a constant field.%

of course this is not physically possible to build, but we will see that if
we look at a large sheet of charge, like the plate of a capacitor, that near
the center, the field approaches this limit, because the sides of the sheet
are far away.%

Let's go back and consider the disk of charge. 
\begin{equation*}
E_{z}=\frac{2\pi \eta }{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\left( 1-\left( 1+\frac{R^{2}}{%
z^{2}}\right) ^{-\frac{1}{2}}\right)
\end{equation*}%
Suppose we look at this distribution from vary far away for a finite disk.
We expect that it should look like a point charge with total charge $Q.$
Let's show that this is true. When $z$ gets very large $R/z$ is very small. 
\begin{equation*}
E_{z\gg R}=\frac{2\pi \eta }{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\left( 1-\left( 1+\frac{R^{2}%
}{z^{2}}\right) ^{-\frac{1}{2}}\right)
\end{equation*}%
Let's look at just the part 
\begin{equation*}
\left( 1+\frac{R^{2}}{z^{2}}\right) ^{-\frac{1}{2}}
\end{equation*}%
This is of the form $\left( 1+x\right) ^{n}$ where $x$ is a small number. We
can use the binomial expansion 
\begin{equation*}
\left( 1+x\right) ^{n}\approx 1+nx\qquad x\ll 1
\end{equation*}%
to write this as%
\begin{equation*}
\left( 1+\frac{R^{2}}{z^{2}}\right) ^{-\frac{1}{2}}\approx 1-\frac{1}{2}%
\frac{R^{2}}{z^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
so in the limit that $z$ is large we have%
\begin{eqnarray*}
E_{z\gg R} &=&\frac{2\pi \eta }{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\left( 1-1+\frac{1}{2}%
\frac{R^{2}}{z^{2}}\right) \\
&=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{\pi \frac{Q}{\pi R^{2}}R^{2}}{z^{2}} \\
&=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{Q}{z^{2}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
Which looks like a point charge as we expected. We have just a small, disk
of charge very far away. That is looks like a point charge with total charge 
$Q.$

\subsection{Spheres, shells, and other geometries.}

I won't do the problem for the field of a charged sphere or spherical shell.
We could, but we will save them for a new technique for finding fields from
configurations of charge that we will learn soon. This new technique will
attempt to make the integration much easier.

\section{Constant electric fields}

Let's try to use what we know about electric fields to predict the motion of
charged particles that are placed in electric fields. We will start with the
simplest case, a charged particle moving in a constant electric field.
Before we take on such a case, we should think about how we could produce a
constant electric field.

We know that a semi-infinite sheet of charge produces a constant electric
field. But we realize that a semi-infinite object is hard to build and hard
to manage. But if the size of the sheet of charge is very large compared to
the charge size, using our solution for a semi-infinite case might not be
too bad if we are away from the edges of the real sheet.

We want to study just such a device. In fact we will use two finite sheets
of charge.

\subsection{Capacitors}

From what we know about charge and conductors, we can charge a large metal
plate by touching it to something that is charged, like a rubber rod, or a
glass rod that has been rubbed with the right material.\FRAME{dtbpF}{2.2442in%
}{1.7106in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language "Scientific Word";type

and touch one with a rubber rod and one with a glass rod, we get two
oppositely charged sheets of charge.

What would the field look like for this oppositely charged set of plates?
Here is one of our thread-in-oil pictures of just such a situation. We are
looking at the plates edge-on. \FRAME{fhFU}{1.7755in}{1.5558in}{0pt}{\Qcb{%

'N8ESC92M.bmp';tempfile-properties "XPR";}} Near the center, the field is
close to constant. Near the sides it is not so much so. We are probably
justified in saying the field in the middle is nearly constant. A look at
the field lines shows us why

\FRAME{dhF}{2.8669in}{1.9519in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

Note that in between the plates, the electric field from the positive plate
is downward. But so is the electric field from the negative plate. The two
fields will add together. Outside the plates, the field from one plate is in
the opposite direction from that of the other plate. The two fields will
nearly cancel. If our device is made of semi-infinite sheets of charge, they
will precisely cancel, because the field of a semi-infinite sheet of charge
is uniform everywhere.

We call this configuration of two charged plates a \emph{capacitor} and, as
you might guess, this type of device proves to be more useful than just
making nearly constant fields. It is a major component in electronic
devices. Before we can build and iPad or a laptop, we will need to
understand several different types of basic devices. This set of charged
plates is our first.

Of course, for real capacitors, the fields outside cancel completely only
near the center of the plates. Near the edges, the direction of the fields
will change, and we get the sort of behavior that we see in figure \ref%
{capacitor-oil-thread} near the edges.

It is probably worth noting that outside the capacitor the field has a \emph{%
magnitude of zero} (or nearly zero). It is not really correct to say that
there is no field. In fact, there are two superimposed fields, or
alternately, a field from each of the charges on each plates, all
superimposed. The fields are there, but their magnitude is zero.

In the middle, then, we will have 
\begin{eqnarray*}
E &=&E_{+}+E_{-} \\
&\approx &\frac{\eta }{2\epsilon _{o}}+\frac{\eta }{2\epsilon _{o}} \\
&=&\frac{\eta }{\epsilon _{o}} \\
&=&\frac{Q}{A\epsilon _{o}}
\end{eqnarray*}

Now that we have a way to form a uniform electric field as our environment,
we can study charged particles moving in this field. And this is really
something we are familiar with. It is very much like a ball in a uniform
gravitational field. But we have the complication of having two different
types of charge. The force on such a particle is given by 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}=q_{m}\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}
\end{equation*}%
but we can combine this with Newton's second law%
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}=m\overrightarrow{\mathbf{a}}
\end{equation*}%
to find the particle's acceleration%
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{a}}=\frac{q\overrightarrow{_{m}\mathbf{E}}}{m}

fields.

\subsection{Millikan}

Let's try a problem. Perhaps you have wondered, \textquotedblleft how do we
know that charge comes in packets of the size of the electron
charge?\textquotedblright\ This is a good story, and uses many of the laws
we have learned.

Robert Millikan devised a clever device in the early 1900's. A picture of
his device is given below.\FRAME{dtbpFU}{5.0301in}{3.061in}{0pt}{\Qcb{%

Millikan made negatively charged oil drops with an atomizer (fine spray
squirt bottle). The drops are introduced between two charged plates into
what we know is essentially a constant electric field. A light shines off
the oil drops, so you can see them through a telescope (not shown). We can
determine the motion of the oil drops just like we did in PH121 or Dynamics.
If the upper plate has the positive charge, then the electric field $%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}$ is downward. A free body diagram for a drop is
shown in the figure to the left of the apparatus. We can write out Newton's
second law for the drop (our mover charge).%
\begin{equation*}
F_{net_{y}}=m_{d}a_{y}=-F_{g}\pm F_{D}+F_{e}
\end{equation*}%
where $F_{D}$ is a drag force because we have air resistance.

If the upper plate has the positive charge, then the electric field $\mathbf{%
\vec{E}}$ is downward. So 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{e}=-q_{m}\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}
\end{equation*}%
The field points down, the charge is negative, so the force is upward
(positive in our favorite coordinate system). We can write newtons's second
law as%
\begin{equation*}
m_{d}a_{y}=-F_{g}\pm F_{D}+qE
\end{equation*}%
If $F_{e}$ is large enough, we can make the oil drop float up! Then the drag
force is downward%
\begin{equation*}
m_{d}a_{y}=-mg-F_{D}+qE
\end{equation*}%
and if we are very careful, we can balance these forces so we have the drop
float upward at a small constant velocity.%
\begin{equation*}
0=-mg-F_{D}+qE
\end{equation*}%
The constant speed is really slow, hundredths of a centimeter per second. so
we can watch the drop move with no problem (except for patience). Once he
achieved a constant speed, by knowing the drop size and density Millikan
could calculate the mass, and therefore the charge. 
\begin{equation*}
mg+F_{D}=q_{m}E
\end{equation*}%
we see that%
\begin{equation*}
q_{m}=\frac{mg+F_{D}}{E}
\end{equation*}%
Which is where our problem ends. But Millikan went farther. He had actual
data, so he could compare charges on different droplets. He found that no
matter what the value for $q_{m},$ it was a multiple of a value, $%
q_{e}=1.602\times 10^{-19}\unit{C}.$ So%
\begin{equation*}
q_{m}=nq_{e}\qquad n=0,\pm 1,\pm 2,\ldots
\end{equation*}%
to within about $1\%.$\footnote{%
There is actually some controversy about this. Apparently Millikan and his
students threw out much of their data, keeping only data on drops that
behaved like they thought they should. They were lucky that this poor
analysis technique did not lead to invalid results! (William Broad and
Nicholas Wade, $\emph{Betrayers}$ \emph{of the truth, }Simon and Schuster,
1983)}. So the smallest charge the drops could have added to them was $%
1\times q_{e}$ and any other larger charge would be a larger multiple of $%
q_{e}.$ The conclusion is that charge comes in units of $q_{e}$. We
recognize $q_{e}$ as the electron charge. You can't add half of an electron
charge. This experiment showed that charge seems to only comes in whole
units!

We may recall that for an object falling in a gravitational field, say, near
the Earth's surface, the acceleration, $g,$ is nearly constant. If we have a
charge moving in a constant electric field, we have a constant acceleration.
From Newtons' second law, 
\begin{equation*}
ma=q_{m}E
\end{equation*}%
we can see that this acceleration is 
\begin{equation*}
a=\frac{q_{m}E}{m}
\end{equation*}%
From our Dynamics or PH121 experience, we have a set of equations to handle
problems that involve constant acceleration%
\begin{eqnarray*}
x_{f} &=&x_{i}+v_{ix}t+\frac{1}{2}a_{x}t^{2} \\
v_{xf} &=&v_{xi}+a_{x}t \\
v_{xf}^{2} &=&v_{xi}^{2}+2a_{x}\Delta x
\end{eqnarray*}%
and%
\begin{eqnarray*}
y_{f} &=&y_{i}+v_{iy}t+\frac{1}{2}a_{y}t^{2} \\
v_{yf} &=&v_{yi}+a_{y}t \\
v_{yf}^{2} &=&v_{yi}^{2}+2a_{y}\Delta y
\end{eqnarray*}

These are know as the \emph{kinematic equations}. You derived them if you
took Dynamics (or derived them and then memorized them if you took PH121).
Let's try a brief problem. Suppose we have a positive charge in a uniform
electric field as shown. \FRAME{dhF}{2.9594in}{1.5601in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{%
\special{language "Scientific Word";type "GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio

"1";cropright "1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename
'N8ESC92R.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}Let $y=0$ at the positive plate.
How fast will the particle be going as it strikes the negative plate?

We use the acceleration%
\begin{eqnarray*}
a_{y} &=&\frac{q_{m}E}{m} \\
a_{x} &=&0
\end{eqnarray*}

For this problem we don't have any $x$-motion, So we can limit ourselves to.%
\begin{eqnarray*}
y_{f} &=&y_{i}+v_{iy}t+\frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{q_{m}E}{m}\right) t^{2} \\
v_{yf} &=&v_{yi}+\left( \frac{q_{m}E}{m}\right) t \\
v_{yf}^{2} &=&v_{yi}^{2}+2\left( \frac{q_{m}E}{m}\right) \Delta y
\end{eqnarray*}

We don't have the time of flight of the particle, but we can identify 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta y=d
\end{equation*}%
The particle started from rest, so 
\begin{equation*}
v_{yo}=0
\end{equation*}%
Therefore it makes sense to use the last of the three equations, because we
know everything that shows up in this equation but the final speed, and that
is what we want to find.%
\begin{eqnarray*}
v_{yf}^{2} &=&v_{yi}^{2}+2\left( \frac{q_{m}E}{m}\right) \Delta y \\
v_{yf}^{2} &=&0+2\left( \frac{q_{m}E}{m}\right) d \\
v_{yf} &=&\sqrt{\frac{2q_{m}Ed}{m}}
\end{eqnarray*}

There is a complication, however. With gravity, we only have one kind of
mass. But with charge we have two kinds of charge. Suppose we have a
negative particle.

Of course the negative particle would not move if it was started from the
positive side. It would be attracted to the positive plate. But suppose we
start the negative particle from the negative plate. It would travel
\textquotedblleft up\textquotedblright\ to the positive plate. We defined
the downward direction as the positive $y$-direction without really thinking
about it. Now we realize that the upward direction must be opposite, so
upward is the negative $y$-direction. Our negative particle will experience
a displacement $\Delta y=-d.$

Then 
\begin{eqnarray*}
v_{yf}^{2} &=&v_{yi}^{2}+2\left( \frac{-q_{m}E}{m}\right) \Delta y \\
v_{yf}^{2} &=&0+2\left( \frac{-q_{m}E}{m}\right) \left( -d\right) \\
v_{yf} &=&\sqrt{\frac{2q_{m}Ed}{m}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
we get the same speed, but this illustrates that we will have to be careful
to watch our signs.

In this last problem we have had only an electric force, no gravitational
force. This is important to notice. If there were also a gravitational
force, we would need to use Newton's second law to add up the forces like we
did with the Millikan problem.

Let's take another example. This time let's send in a negatively charged
particle horizontally through the capacitor. The particle will move up due
to the electric field force. How far up will it go as it travels across the
center of the capacitor? \FRAME{dhF}{2.5547in}{1.708in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{%

'N8ESCA2S.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}Let's define the starting
position as 
\begin{eqnarray*}
x_{i} &=&0 \\
y_{i} &=&0
\end{eqnarray*}%
We can identify that 
\begin{eqnarray*}
v_{ix} &=&v_{0} \\
v_{iy} &=&0
\end{eqnarray*}

And that 
\begin{eqnarray*}
a_{y} &=&\frac{q_{m}E}{m} \\
a_{x} &=&0
\end{eqnarray*}%
We can fill in these values in our kinematic equations

\begin{eqnarray*}
x_{f} &=&0+v_{o}t+\frac{1}{2}\left( 0\right) t^{2} \\
v_{xf} &=&v_{o}+\left( 0\right) t \\
v_{xf}^{2} &=&v_{o}^{2}+2\left( 0\right) \Delta x
\end{eqnarray*}%
and%
\begin{eqnarray*}
y_{f} &=&0+\left( 0\right) t+\frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{q_{m}E}{m}\right) t^{2}
\\
v_{yf} &=&\left( 0\right) +\left( \frac{q_{m}E}{m}\right) t \\
v_{yf}^{2} &=&\left( 0\right) +2\left( \frac{q_{m}E}{m}\right) \left(
y_{f}-0\right)
\end{eqnarray*}%
From the first set we see that $v_{xf}=v_{o},$ that is, the $x$-direction
velocity does not change. That makes sense because we have no force
component in the $x$-direction.

After $t$ seconds we see that the charged particle has traveled a distance 
\begin{equation*}
x_{f}=v_{o}t
\end{equation*}%
If we measure $x_{f}=L$ then we can see how long it took for the particle to
travel through the capacitor%
\begin{equation*}
t=\frac{L}{v_{o}}
\end{equation*}%
Now let's look at the deflection. We can use the first equation of the $y$%
-set 
\begin{eqnarray*}
y_{f} &=&\frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{q_{m}E}{m}\right) t^{2} \\
&=&\frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{q_{m}E}{m}\right) \left( \frac{L}{v_{o}}\right)
^{2}
\end{eqnarray*}

Let's see if this makes sense. If the electric field gets larger, the
particle will deflect more.\FRAME{dhF}{2.6602in}{1.7201in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{%
\special{language "Scientific Word";type "GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio

This is right. The field causes the force, so more field gives more effect
from the force. If we increase the charge, the deflection grows since the
force depends on the charge of the moving particle. This also seems
reasonable. If the mass increases, it is harder to move the particle, so it
makes sense that a larger mass makes a smaller deflection. If the particle
is in the field longer, the deflection will increase, so the dependence on $%
L $ makes sense. Finally, if the initial speed is larger the particle spends
less time in the field, so the deflection will be less.

\section{Non uniform fields}

Of course all of this depends on the field being uniform. For a non uniform
field the force is still 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}=q\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\left( x,y,z\right)
\end{equation*}%
but now the field is a function of position. This makes for a more difficult
problem. For now we will stick to constant fields. If we had to take on a
non-uniform field, we would likely use a numerical technique.

\begin{itemize}
\item Force and torque on a dipole in a uniform field

\item Force on a dipole in a non-uniform field

\item Drawing the shape of a field using symmetry
\end{itemize}

This lecture combines two topics that might be better separated. The first
relates to forces on charges in uniform fields. This is what we discussed
last lecture. The next is the beginning of the ideas that will allow us to
use symmetry and geometry to avoid integration over charges. But because our
lecture times are only an hour, and we can only do so much at once, they are
combined here together. But they form a nice transition between the two
topics this way. We will first study the motion of dipoles in uniform, and
not so uniform fields. We will find symmetry and geometry plays a part in
our solutions. Then we will study the fields of standard symmetric objects.

\section{Dipole motion in an electromagnetic field}

We remember dipoles, a pair of charges of equal magnitude but opposite in
charge, bound together at set separation distance. Let's take our
environment to be a constant electric field, and our mover to be a dipole.%

but this is the mover's self-field and it cannot create a force on the
dipole, so we will not draw it. Of course, if we introduce yet another
charge, $q_{new}$, the environmental field this new charge would feel would
be a combination of both the dipole field and the uniform field! We would
have to draw the superposition of the two fields. \FRAME{dtbpF}{2.1119in}{%

capacitor. Here is what it might look like\FRAME{dhF}{1.753in}{1.9588in}{0pt%

because the force on the dipole charges is just 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}=q\overrightarrow{_{m}\mathbf{E}}
\end{equation*}%
If we know $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}$, then we don't need any information
about it's source to find the force. Since the field is the environment that
the mover charges feel, the field is enough. Let's find the net force on the
dipole due to the environmental field.

&=&m\left( \frac{a}{2}\right) ^{2}+m\left( \frac{a}{2}\right) ^{2} \\
&=&\frac{1}{2}ma^{2}
\end{eqnarray*}%
so our acceleration is 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\alpha &=&\frac{pE\sin \theta }{\frac{1}{2}ma^{2}} \\
&=&\frac{2pE\sin \theta }{ma^{2}}
\end{eqnarray*}

Suppose we look at this for a water molecule in a microwave oven. What is
the maximum angular acceleration experienced by the water molecule if the
oven has a field strength of $E=200\unit{V}/\unit{m}$?

The dipole moment for a water molecule is something like 
\begin{equation*}
p_{w}=6.2\times 10^{-30}\unit{C}\unit{m}
\end{equation*}%
and the separation between the charge centers is something like 
\begin{equation*}
a=3.9\times 10^{-12}\unit{m}
\end{equation*}%
and the molecular mass of water is 
\begin{equation*}
M=18\frac{\unit{g}}{\unit{mol}}
\end{equation*}%
which is 
\begin{equation*}
M=mN_{A}
\end{equation*}%
so the mass of a water molecule is%
\begin{eqnarray*}
m &=&\frac{M}{N_{A}}=\frac{18\frac{\unit{g}}{\unit{mol}}}{6.022\times 10^{23}%
\frac{1}{\unit{mol}}} \\
&=&2.\,\allowbreak 989\times 10^{-26}\allowbreak \unit{kg}
\end{eqnarray*}%
then when $\sin \theta =1$ we will have a maximum%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\alpha &=&\frac{2\left( 6.2\times 10^{-30}\unit{C}\unit{m}\right) \left( 200%
\unit{V}/\unit{m}\right) }{\left( 2.\,\allowbreak 989\times
10^{-26}\allowbreak \unit{kg}\right) \left( 3.9\times 10^{-12}\unit{m}%
\right) ^{2}} \\
&=&5.\,\allowbreak 455\times 10^{21}\frac{\unit{rad}}{\unit{s}^{2}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
Our numbers were kind of rough estimates, but still the result is amazing.
Imagine if this happened inside of you! which is why we really should be
careful with microwave ovens and microwave equipment.

\subsection{Induced dipoles}

Suppose that we place a large insulator in a uniform electric field.

\FRAME{dhF}{3.1055in}{2.2001in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

become dipoles. We say we have \emph{induced} dipoles within the material.
Notice that in the middle of the conductor there is still no net charge. But
because we have made the atoms into dipoles, one side of the insulator
becomes negatively charged and the other side becomes positively charged.
This does not create a net force, but we will find that separating the
charges like this can be useful in building capacitors.

\subsection{Non-uniform fields and dipoles}

Suppose we place our dipole in a non-uniform field? Of course the result
will depend on the field, so let's take an example. Let's place a dipole in
the field due to a point charge.\FRAME{dhF}{2.0574in}{2.0539in}{0pt}{}{}{%

'N8ESCC38.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}We can see that the field is much
weaker at the location of the positive charge than it is at the negative
charge location. If we zoom in on the location near our dipole we can see
that now we will have an acceleration! \FRAME{dhF}{2.8781in}{1.0205in}{0pt}{%
}{}{Figure}{\special{language "Scientific Word";type

\begin{equation*}
\Sigma F_{x}=-F_{-}+F_{+}=ma_{x}
\end{equation*}%
so%
\begin{equation*}
-qE_{\text{large}}+qE_{\text{small}}=ma_{x}
\end{equation*}

Let's go back to our charged balloon from many lectures ago. We found that
the charge \textquotedblleft leaked off\textquotedblright\ our balloon. We
can see why now. The water molecules in the air are attracted to the
charges, and stick to them. When the water molecules float off, they will
take our charge with them. We can calculate the net force easily with our
field from a dipole that we found earlier, 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}_{y}=\frac{2}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{p}}}{L^{3}}
\end{equation*}%
then the force on the electron on the balloon is 
\begin{eqnarray*}
F &=&q_{e}E \\
&=&\frac{2q_{e}}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{p}{L^{3}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
So if the dipole is about a $0.01\unit{cm}$ away 
\begin{eqnarray*}
F &=&\frac{2\left( 1.602\times 10^{-19}\right) }{4\pi \left( 8.85\times
10^{-12}\frac{\unit{C}^{2}}{\unit{N}\unit{m}^{2}}\right) }\frac{6.2\times
10^{-30}\unit{C}\unit{m}}{\left( 0.01\unit{cm}\right) ^{3}} \\
&=&1.\,\allowbreak 786\,2\times 10^{-26}\unit{N}
\end{eqnarray*}%
But wait! we used the dipole as the environmental object and the single
charge as the mover. So this is the force on the single charge! But by
Newton's third law, the force on the dipole due to the electron must have
the same magnitude and opposite direction so%
\begin{equation*}
F_{dipole}=-1.\,\allowbreak 786\,2\times 10^{-26}\unit{N}
\end{equation*}%
We could also use Coulomb's law for a point charge, since we know the field
equation. Taking the point charge as the environmental charge and the dipole
charges as the movers,%
\begin{eqnarray*}
-qE_{\text{large}}+qE_{\text{small}} &=&ma_{x} \\
-q\left( \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{Q}{r_{-}^{2}}\right) +q\left( 
\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{Q}{r_{+}^{2}}\right) &=&ma_{x}
\end{eqnarray*}%
or 
\begin{equation*}
\frac{Qq}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\left( \frac{1}{r_{+}^{2}}-\frac{1}{r_{-}^{2}}%
\right) =ma_{x}=F_{net}
\end{equation*}%
this is the net force on a dipole due to the point charge.

From our estimations, the effective charge on one side of the water molecule
is 
\begin{eqnarray*}
q &=&\frac{p}{a}=\frac{6.2\times 10^{-30}\unit{C}\unit{m}}{3.9\times 10^{-12}%
\unit{m}} \\
&=&1.\,\allowbreak 589\,7\times 10^{-18}\allowbreak \unit{A}\unit{s}
\end{eqnarray*}%
(how can this be true?) so if the dipole is abut a $0.01\unit{cm}$ away then 
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{net} &=&\frac{\left( 1.0\times 10^{-19}\right) \left( 1.\,\allowbreak
589\,7\times 10^{-18}\allowbreak \unit{A}\unit{s}\right) }{4\pi \left(
8.85\times 10^{-12}\frac{\unit{C}^{2}}{\unit{N}\unit{m}^{2}}\right) } \\
&&\times \left( \frac{1}{\left( 0.01\unit{cm}+\frac{3.9\times 10^{-12}\unit{m%
}}{2}\right) ^{2}}-\frac{1}{\left( 0.01\unit{cm}-\frac{3.9\times 10^{-12}%
\unit{m}}{2}\right) ^{2}}\right) \\
&=&-1.\,\allowbreak 115\,0\times 10^{-26}\unit{N}
\end{eqnarray*}%
We expect the negative sign, both forces should be to the left. The answers
are different, but within one order of magnitude. This is pretty good since
for our dipole field we assumed that the distance from the dipole is very
large and $0.01\unit{cm}$ is a somewhat shorter version of very large!

\section{Symmetry}

The symmetry of the uniform field figured strongly in the dipole problem.
When the shape of the field changed, so did the resulting motion. This
suggests that we could solve some problems just knowing the symmetry, or at
least that symmetry might help us do simple predictions to help get a
problem started. We need to be able to predict the field lines of a geometry
to draw a picture to start solving a problem.

We have run into two geometries so far that have been helpful\FRAME{dhF}{%

The infinite line of charge and the semi-infinite sheet of charge. We have
found for the sheet that the field is constant everywhere. This is strongly
symmetric. We could envision translating the sheet within the plane right or
left. The field would look the same. We could envision reflecting the sheet
so the left side is now the right side. That would also not change the
field. We can say that the field of the sheet would be symmetric about
translation within the plane of the sheet and symmetric on reflection.

Suppose we look at the sheet side-on. Suppose that we thought the field came
off the sheet at an angle as shown. \FRAME{dhF}{1.9069in}{1.1857in}{0pt}{}{}{%

part) the shape of the charge distribution did not change on reflection. The
sheet really looks just the same. It dose not make sense that we should
change the shape of the field if the shape of the charge distribution did
not change. So we can tell that this can't be the right field shape.%

We can do this with any symmetric distribution of charge. Think of the
infinite line of charge. If we move it left or right the field definitely
changes. So it is not symmetric about translation along, say, the $x$-axis.
But if we move the wire along it's own axis, (for my coordinate system,
along the $y$-axis) it should be symmetric because the charge distribution
won't look different. We can guess from the last example that the field must
come straight out perpendicular to the line of charge. It must be
perpendicular, but what direction? Look at this end view. The field lines do
come straight out, so this meets our criteria for being perpendicular to the
line. \FRAME{dhF}{1.4079in}{1.9865in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

The field lines follow our symmetry guidelines. Because of the symmetry of
the sheet of the field lines must be perpendicular to the sheets.

Again building from the line of charge, we can build more complex geometries%

In the figure we have two positively charged concentric cylinders. The field
is very reminiscent of a line charge field, and we can see that it must be
using the same symmetry rules.

Of course the cylinders don't have to have the same charge.\FRAME{dhF}{%

"1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename 'N8ESCD3I.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}%
If the interior cylinder is positively charged and the exterior cylinder is
negatively charged, we have a situation much like the capacitor. Each
cylinder has a field outside the system, but those fields cancel out if
there are equal charges on each cylinder. This situation is similar to a
coaxial cable, and we will revisit it later in the course.

For the charge configurations we have drawn so far, we must keep in mind
that they are infinite in at least one dimension. Finite configurations of
charge in lines or sheets will have curved fields at the ends. The fields
will be symmetric on reflection about their centers, but not on translation
of any sort. Still, we will continue to use semi-infinite approximations in
this class, and these constructs are good mental images under many
circumstances.

Of course we can have a sphere. Spheres are very symmetrical, so we can
guess using our symmetry ideas that the field from a charged sphere should
be perpendicular to the surface of the sphere everywhere.

\FRAME{dhF}{3.0701in}{2.0937in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

We can see that this is true for both the sphere and for concentric spheres
or any configuration of charge that is spherical.

If you took PH123 or have had a class that deals with fluids, I\ can use an
analogy (if not, you will probably be OK, because you have probably used a
garden hose). Let's recall some fluid dynamics for a moment. Remember what
we called a \emph{flow rate}? This was from the equation of continuity%
\begin{equation*}
v_{1}A_{1}=v_{2}A_{2}
\end{equation*}%
\FRAME{dtbpF}{2.917in}{1.6579in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

}We wanted to know how much liquid was going by a particular part of the
pipe in a given unit of time. We called $vA$ a \emph{flow rate}.

\subsection{The idea of electric flux}

I want to introduce an analogous concept. But this time I\ want to use the
electric field instead of water speed%
\begin{equation*}
\Phi =EA
\end{equation*}%
This is just like our flow rate in some ways. It is something multiplied by
an area. In fact, it is how much of something goes through an area. We could
guess that it is the amount of electric field that passes through the area, $%
A.$ Now the electric fields we have dealt with so far don't flow. They just
stay put (we will let them change later in the course). So it is only \emph{%
like }a flow rate. But it is useful to think of this as \textquotedblleft
how much of something passes by an area,\textquotedblright\ and the
\textquotedblleft something\textquotedblright\ is the electric field in this
case. Let's consider a picture \FRAME{dhF}{2.1326in}{2.0799in}{0pt}{}{}{%

}In this picture, we have a rectangular area, $A,$ and the red arrows
represent the field lines of the electric field. The arrows penetrate the
area like a target. So there is a number of arrows that go through the area.
They don't flow through the area, but they do penetrate it. We can picture
the quantity, $\Phi ,$ as the number of field lines that pass through $A.$
Remember that the number of field lines we draw is greater if the field
strength is higher, so this quantity, $\Phi ,$ tells us something about the
strength of the field over the area.

}We define an angle, $\theta $ (our favorite greek letter, but we could of
course use $\beta $ or $\alpha ,$ or $\zeta $ or whatever) that is the angle
between the field direction and the area. A more mathematical way to do this
is to define a vector that is perpendicular to (normal to) the surface $%
\mathbf{\hat{n}}$. Then we can use this vector and one of the field lines to
define $\theta .$ It will be the angle between $\mathbf{\hat{n}}$ and the
field lines.

Of course either way gives the same $\theta .$

field lines passing through $A,$ but of course, now there are fewer lines
passing through the area because it is tilted. We can find $\Phi $ using $%

}The smaller area is called the \emph{projected area}.

We can see that by tipping our area, we get fewer field lines that penetrate
that area.

Really the number of field lines is just proportional to $E,$ so we won't
ever really count field lines. But this is a good mental picture for what
flux means. Really we will calculate%
\begin{equation*}
\Phi =EA\cos \theta
\end{equation*}

The $\cos \theta $ with two magnitudes (field strength and area) multiplying
it should remind you of something. It looks like the result of a vector dot
product. If $E$ and $A$ were both vectors, then we could write the flux as%
\begin{equation}
\Phi =\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot \overrightarrow{\mathbf{A}}
\end{equation}%

Well, we can define a vector that has $A$ as it's magnitude and is in the
right direction to make 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot \overrightarrow{\mathbf{A}}=EA\cos \theta
\end{equation*}%
We define the \emph{area vector}%
\begin{equation}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{A}}=\mathbf{\hat{n}}A
\end{equation}

Notice that for an open surface (one that does not form a closed surface
with a empty space inside) we have to choose which side $\mathbf{\hat{n}}$
will point from. We can choose either side. But once we have made the
choice, we have to stick with it for the entire problem we are solving.

Suppose the area we have is not flat? Then what? Well let's recall that if
we take a sphere the surface will be curved. But if we take a bigger sphere,
and look at the same amount of area on that sphere, it looks less curved.%

}This becomes more apparent if we remove the rest of the circle or sphere to
take away the visual cures our eyes and minds use to say something is curved%

Suppose we take a curved surface but we just look at a very small part of
that surface. This would be very like magnifying our circle. We would see an
increasingly flat surface piece compared to our increased scale of our image.

This gives us the idea that for an element of area, $\Delta A$ we could find
an element of flux $\Delta \Phi $ for this small part of the whole curved
surface. Essentially $\Delta A$ is flat (or we would just take a smaller $%
\Delta A).$%
\begin{equation}
\Delta \Phi =\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot \Delta \overrightarrow{\mathbf{%
A}}
\end{equation}%
This is just a small piece of the total flux through the curved surface, the
total flux through our whole curved surface is 
\begin{equation}
\Phi _{E}\approx \dsum \Delta \Phi
\end{equation}

Of course, to make this exact, we will take the limit as $\Delta
A\rightarrow 0$ resulting in an integral. We find the flux through a curved
surface to be%
\begin{equation}
\Phi _{E}=\lim_{\Delta A\rightarrow 0}\dsum\limits_{i}\overrightarrow{%
\mathbf{E}}\cdot \Delta \overrightarrow{\mathbf{A}}_{i}=\int_{surface}%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{A}}
\end{equation}%
Notice that this is a \emph{surface integral}. It may be that you have not
done surface integrals for some time, but we will practice in the upcoming
lectures.

\subsection{Closed surfaces}

Suppose we build a box with our areas. \FRAME{dhF}{3.3503in}{1.7461in}{0pt}{%

going in and some going out. By convention we will call the flux formed by
the ones going in negative and the flux formed by the ones going out
positive.

From these questions we see that if there is no charge inside of the box,
the net flux must be zero. We could take any size or shape of closed surface
and this would be true! But if we do have charge inside of the box we expect
there to be a net flux. If it is a negative net charge, it will be an
negative flux and if it is a positive net charge it will be a positive net
flux. Next lecture we will formalize this as a new law of physics, but for
now we need to remember from M215 or M113 how to write an integration over a
closed surface. We use a special integral sign with a circle

\begin{equation}
\Phi _{E}=\doint \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{A}%
}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Flux example: a sphere}

For each type of surface we choose, we need an area element, $dA,$ with
which we perform the integration. This is a lot like finding $dq$ in our
electric field integral. In our integration of the electric field due to a
distribution of charges, we have used elements of area for flat surfaces.
Remember our integration of over a disk of charge. We had a small area
element 
\begin{equation*}
dA=rdrd\phi
\end{equation*}%
and to find $dq$ we just multiplied by the surface charge density. 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{A}}
\end{equation*}%
is very similar. So we are familiar ground when we find elements of area.

But so far we have not found an area element for a sphere. Let's tackle that
now. We can start by finding the coordinates of a point, $P,$ on the surface
of the sphere.

Let's build an area by defining a sort of box shape on the surface by
allowing a change in $\theta $ and $\phi $ ($\Delta \theta $ and $\Delta
\phi $). First $\Delta \theta ,$

\FRAME{dtbpF}{1.932in}{2.0989in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

a circle that passes through the \textquotedblleft north
pole\textquotedblright\ and \textquotedblleft south pole\textquotedblright\
of our sphere. By changing $\theta $ we get a small bit of arc length. We
remember that the length of an arc is 
\begin{equation}
s_{\theta }=r\theta
\end{equation}%
where $\theta $ is in radians. So we expect that 
\begin{equation}
\Delta s_{\theta }=r\Delta \theta
\end{equation}%
We can check this by integrating%
\begin{equation}
\int_{0}^{2\pi }rd\theta =r\int_{0}^{2\pi }d\theta =2\pi r
\end{equation}%
Just as we expect, the integral of arc length around the whole circle is the
circumference of the circle. Then $\Delta s_{\theta }$ is one side of our
small box-like area, the box height.

Now let's look at $\phi $

\FRAME{dtbpF}{2.4846in}{2.5529in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

the sphere, but it's size depends on $\theta .$ Near the north pole, the
radius of the $\phi $-circle is very small. At $\theta =0$, the $\phi $%
-circle is in the $xy$ plane and has radius $r.$ We can write the radius of
the $\phi $-circle as a projection over $90\unit{%

length formula again to find 
\begin{equation}
s_{\phi }=\left( r\sin \theta \right) \phi

a change in arch length will be%
\begin{equation}
\Delta s_{\phi }=\left( r\sin \theta \right) \Delta \phi

\begin{equation}

which is the area of our small box. We have found an element of area on the
surface of the sphere! all we have to do is to let the $\Delta $'s become $d$%
's. 
\begin{equation}
dA\approx ds_{\theta }\times ds_{\phi }=rd\theta r\sin \theta d\phi
\end{equation}%
Let's check our element of area by integration. After changing $\Delta $ to $%
d$ and rearranging%
\begin{equation}
dA=r^{2}\sin \theta d\theta d\phi
\end{equation}%
then 
\begin{equation}
A=\int \int r^{2}\sin \theta d\theta d\phi
\end{equation}%
we have to be careful not to over count area. Let's view this as first
integrating around the circle of radius $r\sin \theta $ over the variable $%
\phi ,$ then an integration of all these circles as $\theta $ changes from $%
0 $ to $\pi $

\begin{eqnarray}
A &=&\int_{0}^{\pi }\int_{0}^{2\pi }r^{2}\sin \theta d\phi d\theta \\
&=&r^{2}\int_{0}^{\pi }\sin \theta d\theta \int_{0}^{2\pi }d\phi  \notag \\
&=&2\pi r^{2}\int_{0}^{\pi }\sin \theta d\theta  \notag \\
&=&4\pi r^{2}  \notag

as we expect.

We are now ready to do a simple problem.\FRAME{dhF}{1.8749in}{1.0118in}{0pt}{%

'N8ESCD3T.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}Let's calculate the flux through
a spherical surface if there is a point charge at the center of the sphere.
The field of the point charge is 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{Q_{E}}{r^{2}}%
\mathbf{\hat{r}}
\end{equation*}%
then the flux through the surface is 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Phi _{E} &=&\doint \mathbf{\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A}} \\
&=&\doint \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{Q_{E}}{r^{2}}\mathbf{\hat{r}%
\cdot d\vec{A}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
but $\mathbf{\hat{r}}$ is always in the same direction as $\mathbf{d\vec{A}}$
for this case, so 
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{\hat{r}\cdot d\vec{A}}=(1)dA\cos \left( 0\right) =dA
\end{equation*}%
which gives us just 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Phi _{E} &=&\frac{Q_{E}}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\doint \frac{1}{r^{2}}dA \\
&=&\frac{Q_{E}}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\doint \frac{1}{r^{2}}r^{2}\sin \theta
d\theta d\phi \\
&=&\frac{Q_{E}}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\int_{0}^{\pi }\left( \int_{0}^{2\pi
}d\phi \right) \sin \theta d\theta \\
&=&\frac{Q_{E}}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}4\pi \\
&=&\frac{Q_{E}}{\epsilon _{o}}
\end{eqnarray*}

Some comments are in order. Our surfaces that we are using to calculate flux
might be a real object. You might calculate the electric flux leaving a
microwave oven, or a computer case to make sure you are in keeping emissions
within FCC rules. But more likely the surface is purely imaginary--\emph{%
just something we make up}.

Symmetry is going to be very important in doing problems with flux. So we
will often make up very symmetrical surfaces to help us with our problems.
In today's problem, the fact that $\mathbf{\hat{r}}$ and $d\mathbf{A}$ were
in the same direction made the integral \emph{much} easier.

Until next lecture, it may not seem beneficial to invent some strange
symmetrical surface and then to calculate the flux through that surface. But
it is, and it will have the effect of turning a long, difficult integral
into a simple one, when we can pull it off.

\subsection{Flux example: a long straight wire}

Let's take another example. A long straight wire.\FRAME{dhF}{2.2087in}{%
1.8836in}{0in}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language "Scientific Word";type

We remember that the field from a long straight wire is approximately 
\begin{equation*}
E=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{2\left\vert \lambda \right\vert }{r}
\end{equation*}%
The symmetry of the field suggests an imaginary surface for measuring the
flux. A cylinder matches the geometry well. Let's find the flux through an
imaginary cylinder that is $L$ tall and has a radius $r$ and is concentric
with the line of charge. Note that we are totally making up the cylindrical
surface. There is not really any surface there at all.

The flux will be 
\begin{equation*}
\Phi _{E}=\doint \mathbf{\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A}}
\end{equation*}%
We can view this as three separate integrals 
\begin{equation*}
\Phi _{E}=\doint_{top}\mathbf{\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A}+}\doint_{side}\mathbf{%
\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A}+}\doint_{bottom}\mathbf{\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A}}
\end{equation*}%
since our cylinder has end caps (the top and bottom) and a curved side.

Let's consider the end caps first. For both the top and the bottom ends, $%
\mathbf{\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A}}=0$ everywhere. No field goes thorough the
ends. So there is no flux through the ends of the cylinder.

There is flux through the side of the cylinder. Note that the field is
perpendicular to the side surface everywhere. So $\mathbf{\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{%
A}}=EdA.$ We can write our flux as 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Phi _{E} &=&\doint_{side}EdA \\
&=&\doint \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{2\left\vert \lambda \right\vert 
}{r}dA
\end{eqnarray*}%
Integrated over the side surface. But we will need an element of surface
area $dA$ for a cylinder side.

Cylindrical coordinates seem logical so let's try%
\begin{equation*}
dA=rd\theta dz
\end{equation*}%
then%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Phi _{E} &=&\doint \doint \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{2\left\vert
\lambda \right\vert }{r}rd\theta dz \\
&=&\frac{2\left\vert \lambda \right\vert }{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}%

&=&\frac{\left\vert \lambda \right\vert }{2\pi \epsilon _{o}}\left( 2\pi
L\right) \\
&=&\frac{\left\vert \lambda \right\vert }{\epsilon _{o}}L
\end{eqnarray*}%
So far we have, indeed, made integrals that look hard but are really easy to
do. But note that this would be \emph{much} harder if the wire were not at
the center of the cylinder, or if in the previous example the charge had
been off to one side of the sphere.

We would still like to remove such difficulties if we can. And often we can
by choosing our imaginary surface so that the symmetry is there. But
sometimes that is harder. or worse yet, we don't know exactly where the
charges are in a complicated configuration of charge. We will take this on
next lecture when we study a technique for finding the electric field
invented by Gauss.

the same result. Wouldn't it be great if the flux through every closed
surface was this simple? Then we would not have to integrate at all!

It does not depend on the radius of the spherical surface. So any spherical
surface centered on the charge will do! This makes sense. No matter how big
the sphere, all the field lines must leave it. Since flux gives the amount
of field that penetrates an area, for our charge at the center of a sphere
we see that all of the field penetrates the spherical surface no matter the
size of the sphere. So the flux is the same no matter $r.$\footnote{%
If this still seems strange, remember that the area of a sphere is $4\pi
r^{2}$ and that the field of a point charge is $\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}%
\frac{Q}{r^{2}}$. The flux is like the product of these two quantities. The $%
r^{2}$ terms must cancel. So the fact that the flux is the same for any
sphere is due to the $r^{2}$ dependence of the field.}

lecture problems easy was that the field was always perpendicular to the
surface so $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{A}}%
=EdA $ was easy to find.

Using geometry we can arrange to make nearly all of our flux problems like
this. To demonstrate, let's take the case of a point charge that is off
center.\FRAME{dhF}{2.7121in}{1.6743in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

'N8ESCE3Y.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}This would make for a difficult
integration because $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}$ and $d\overrightarrow{%
\mathbf{A}}$ have different directions as we go around the sphere. But let's
consider, would there be less flux through the surface than there was when
the charge was centered in the sphere? Every field line that is generated
will still leave the surface. Flux gives us the amount of field that
penetrates the surface.\footnote{%
Think of water flow rate again. We could place the end of a garden hose in a
wire mesh container. The water would flow out the hose end and through the
wire mesh sides of the container. The flow rate tells us how much water
passes through the container surface. The flow rate does not depend on the
shape of the container. The hose end is like a charge. The hose is the
source of water, the charge is the source of electric field.} Since flux is
the amount of field penetrating our surface, it seems that the flux should
be exactly the same as when the charge was in the center of the sphere. To
prove this, let's take our surface and approximate it using area segments.
But let's have the area segments be either along a radius of a sphere
centered on the charge, or along the surface of a sphere centered on the
charge.\FRAME{dhF}{3.2984in}{2.162in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

'N8ESCE3Z.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}No flux goes through the radial
pieces. And the rest of the pieces are all parts of spheres centered on the
charge. But for the spherical segments, the field will be perpendicular to
the segment no matter what sphere the segment is a part of, because we chose
only spheres that were concentric with the charge. The $r$ we have for the
little spherical pieces does not matter, so on all of these surfaces $%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{A}}=EdA.$ Then the
integration for these pieces will be easy.

Of course this surface made of little segments from other spheres is a poor
approximation to the shape of the offset sphere. But we can make our small
segments smaller and smaller. In the limit that they are infinitely small,
our shape becomes the offset sphere. That means that once again our flux is%
\begin{equation*}
\Phi =\frac{Q_{E}}{\epsilon _{o}}
\end{equation*}%
This is fantastic! We don't have to do the integration at all. We just count
up the charge inside our surface and divide by $\epsilon _{o}.$

What happens if the charge is on the outside of the surface?\FRAME{dhF}{%

Every field line that enters goes back out. We encountered this last time.
The flux going in is negative, the flux going out is positive, and they must
be the same because every line leaves that enters. So the net flux must be
zero. The means we should still write our flux as%
\begin{equation*}
\Phi =\frac{Q_{inside}}{\epsilon _{o}}
\end{equation*}%
because outside charges won't contribute to the flux. So in a way, our
expression works for charges outside our closed surface.

We know that fields superimpose, that is, they add up, so we would expect
that if we have two charges inside a surface, \FRAME{dhF}{3.0191in}{2.4976in%

contributions to the total flux%
\begin{equation*}
\Phi _{total}=\Phi _{1}+\Phi _{2}
\end{equation*}%
which means that $Q_{inside}$ is the sum of all the charges inside. We
recognize that if some charges are negative, they will cancel equal amounts
of charge that are positive.

This leaves us with a fantastic time savings law

\begin{Note}
The electric flux $\Phi $ through any closed surface is equal to the net
charge inside the surface multiplied by $4\pi k_{e}.$ The closed surface is
often called a \emph{Gaussian Surface.}%
\begin{equation}
\Phi _{E}=\doint \vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A}=\frac{Q_{inside}}{\varepsilon _{o}}
\end{equation}
\end{Note}

This was first expressed by Gauss, and therefore this expression is called
Gauss' law.

But why do we get so excited about flux? The reason is that we can use the
idea of flux combined with Gauss' law gives us an easy way to calculate the
electric field from a distribution of charge if we can find a suitable
symmetric surface! If we can find the field, we can find forces, and we can
predict motion.

Let's show how to do this by working some examples.

\subsubsection{Charged Spherical Shell}

First let's take a charged spherical shell and find the field inside.\FRAME{%
fhF}{1.9147in}{2.0764in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language "Scientific

}We need to be able to guess the shape of the field. We use symmetry. We can
guess that the field will be radial both inside and outside of the shell. If
it were not so, then our symmetry tests would fail.

The shell has a total charge of $+Q$. If we place a spherical surface inside
the shell, then we can use Gauss's law.%
\begin{equation*}
\Phi =\frac{Q_{inside}}{\epsilon _{o}}
\end{equation*}%
We can tell from the symmetry of the situation that $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{%
E}}$ is everywhere colinear with (but in the opposite direction as) $d%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{A}}$ so 
\begin{equation*}
\Phi =\doint \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{A}}%
=-\doint EdA
\end{equation*}%
because the field is everywhere perpendicular to the surface. We can even
make a guess that the field must be constant on this surface, because all
along the spherical Gaussian surface there is extreme symmetry. No change in
reflection, or rotation etc. will change the shape of the charge, so around
the spherical surface the field must have the same value. Then 
\begin{equation*}
\Phi =-E\doint dA=-EA
\end{equation*}%
Equating our flux equations gives

\begin{equation*}
-EA=\frac{Q_{inside}}{\epsilon _{o}}
\end{equation*}%
or%
\begin{equation*}
E=-\frac{Q_{inside}}{A\epsilon _{o}}
\end{equation*}%
but what is $Q_{inside}?$ It is zero! so%
\begin{equation*}
E=-\frac{0}{A\epsilon _{o}}=0
\end{equation*}%
There is no net field inside!

This may seem surprising, but think of placing a test charge, $q_{o}$,
inside the sphere. The next figure shows the forces acting on such a test
charge. The force is stronger between the charge and the near surface, but
there is more of the surface tugging the other way. \FRAME{dhF}{1.593in}{%

'N8ESCE42.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}The forces just balance. Since 
\begin{equation*}
F=qE
\end{equation*}%
if the net force is zero, then the field must be zero too.

Is there a field outside of the spherical shell? It is still true that%
\begin{equation*}

\end{equation*}%
but this time we have a positive sign on the last integral because $%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}$ and $d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{A}}$ are in the
same direction. Then 
\begin{equation*}
EA=+\frac{Q_{inside}}{\epsilon _{o}}
\end{equation*}%
We now choose our surface around the entire shell\FRAME{fhF}{1.567in}{%

}All of our analysis is the same as in our last problem, except now $%
Q_{inside}$ is not zero%
\begin{equation*}
E=\frac{Q_{inside}}{A\epsilon _{o}}
\end{equation*}%
The area is the area of our imaginary sphere%
\begin{equation*}
E=\frac{Q_{inside}}{\left( 4\pi r^{2}\right) \epsilon _{o}}
\end{equation*}%
and since $Q_{inside}=+Q,$ then%
\begin{equation*}
E=\frac{+Q}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}r^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
and we have found the field.

Note that this field looks very like a point charge at the center of the
spherical shell (at the center of charge), but by now that is not much of a
surprise!

\subsubsection{Strategy for Gauss' law problems}

Let's review what we have done before we go on to our last example. For each
Gauss' law problem, we

\begin{enumerate}
\item draw the charge distribution \FRAME{dtbpF}{1.0564in}{1.0786in}{0in}{}{%

\item Draw the field lines using symmetry \FRAME{dtbpF}{1.6525in}{1.6533in}{%
0in}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language "Scientific Word";type

1.656in;cropleft "0";croptop "1";cropright "1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename
'N8ESCE44.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}

\item Choose (make up, invent) a closed surface that makes $\overrightarrow{%
\mathbf{E}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{A}}$ either just $EdA$ or $0.$%
\FRAME{dtbpF}{1.9301in}{1.9318in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

'N8ESCF45.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}

\item Find $Q_{in}.$

\item Solve $\doint EdA=\frac{Q_{inside}}{\epsilon _{o}}$ for the non, zero
parts
\end{enumerate}

The integral should be trivial now due to our use of symmetry.

\subsubsection{An infinite sheet of charge.}

Spherical cases were easy. Let's try a harder one. Let's try our infinite
sheet of charge. It is a little hard to draw. So we will draw it looking at
it from the side from within the sheet of charge (somewhere in it's middle,
if an infinite sheet can have a middle).\FRAME{dtbpF}{3.6224in}{0.2253in}{0in%

For step 2), let's think about what the electric field will look like.\FRAME{%
dtbpF}{4.1018in}{1.5195in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language "Scientific
Word";type "GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio TRUE;display "USEDEF";valid_file

In the figure above I\ have blown up the view on three charge carriers and
drawn some field lines. Notice that in the $x-$direction the fields will
cancel.\FRAME{dtbpF}{4.0032in}{0.8198in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

So we have only a field in the $y$ direction \FRAME{dtbpF}{4.2047in}{1.5126in%

3.0934in;cropleft "0";croptop "1";cropright "1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename
'N8ESCF4A.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}Now if we had edges of our sheet
of charge, not all the $x-$components would cancel and the problem would be
harder, but we won't do that problem now. Also note that there is a field in
the $-y$-direction, I\ only drew some of the field lines in the figures.%
\FRAME{dtbpF}{3.2029in}{1.9806in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

"1";cropright "1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename
'N8ESCF4B.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}This is step 2).

Now we need to choose an imaginary surface over which to integrate $\doint 
\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A}.$ We want $\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A}=EdA$ or $\vec{E}\cdot
d\vec{A}=0$ over all parts of the surface. I suggest a cylinder. \FRAME{dhF}{%
2.8089in}{1.7582in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language "Scientific

"1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename 'N8ESCF4C.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}%
Note that along the top of the cylinder, $E\parallel A$ so $\vec{E}\cdot d%
\vec{A}=EdA\cos \theta =EdA.$ Along the side of the cylinder $E\perp A$ so $%
\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A}=EdA\cos \theta =0.$ We have a surface that works! This
completes step 3).

Now we need to solve the integral. The flux is just 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Phi &=&\doint \vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A} \\
\Phi &=&\doint_{side}\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A}+\doint_{ends}\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A}
\\
&=&0+\doint_{ends}EdA=2EA
\end{eqnarray*}%
where the factor of $2$ comes because we have two caps and field in the $+y$
and $-y$ directions and where $A$ is the area of one end cap. If we know
that the sheet of charge has a surface charge density of $\eta ,$ then we
can write the charge enclosed by the cylinder as%
\begin{equation*}
Q_{inside}=\eta A
\end{equation*}%
so%
\begin{equation*}
\Phi _{E}=\frac{\eta A}{\varepsilon _{o}}
\end{equation*}%
by Gauss' law. Equating the two expressions for the flux gives%
\begin{equation*}
2EA=\frac{\eta A}{\varepsilon _{o}}
\end{equation*}%
or%
\begin{equation}
E=\frac{\eta }{2\varepsilon _{o}}
\end{equation}%
which is what we found before for an infinite sheet of charge, but this way
was \emph{much} easier. If we can find a suitable surface, Gauss' law is
very powerful!

\subsection{Gauss's law strategy}

In each of our problems today, we found the electric field without a nasty
integration. Usually we want the electric field at a specific point. To make
Gauss' law work we need to do the following for each problem:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Draw the charge distribution

\item Draw the field using symmetry

\item Invent a Gaussian surface that takes advantage of the field symmetry
and that includes our point where we want the field. We will want $%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{A}}=EdA$ or $%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{A}}=0$ for each
part of the surface we invent.

\item Find the flux by finding the enclosed charge, $Q_{in}$

\item use $\doint \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{A%
}}=\frac{Q_{in}}{\epsilon _{o}}$ integrating over our carefully invented
surface to find the field. If our surface that we imagined was good, then $%
\doint \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{A}}$ will
be very easy.%

\section{Derivation of Gauss' Law}

A formal derivation of Gauss' Law is instructive, and it gives us the
opportunity to introduce the idea of solid angle.\FRAME{dtbpF}{2.5573in}{%

\begin{equation}
\Delta \Omega =\frac{\Delta A}{r^{2}}
\end{equation}%
This is like a two dimensional angle. And just like an angle, it really does
not have dimensions. Note that $\Delta A$ is a length squared, but so is $%
r^{2}.$ The (dimensionless) unit for solid angle is the \emph{steradian}. We
can see that for a sphere we would have a total solid angle of 
\begin{equation}
\Omega _{sphere}=\frac{4\pi r^{2}}{r^{2}}=4\pi \unit{sr}
\end{equation}%
Now let's see why this is useful. Consider a point charge in an arbitrary
closed surface. \FRAME{dtbpF}{1.6431in}{1.5843in}{0in}{}{}{Figure}{\special%

element of surface $\Delta A$ we can find the flux through that surface
element. We can use our idea of solid angle to do this

\FRAME{dhF}{3.6487in}{2.8184in}{0in}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

\begin{equation*}
\Delta \Phi _{E}=\mathbf{\vec{E}\cdot \Delta \vec{A}}
\end{equation*}%
Since the field lines are symmetric about $q$ and the surface is arbitrary,
the element $\Delta \mathbf{\vec{A}}$ will be at some angle $\theta $ from
the field direction so 
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{\vec{E}\cdot \Delta \vec{A}=}E\Delta A\cos \theta
\end{equation*}%
this is no surprise. But now notice that the projection of $\Delta A$ puts
it onto a spherical surface of just about the same distance from $q.$ The
projected area is 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta A_{P}=\Delta A\cos \theta
\end{equation*}%
At this point we should remember that we know the field due to a point charge%
\begin{equation*}
E=\frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon _{o}}\frac{q}{r^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
so our flux through the area element is%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta \Phi _{E} &=&\frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon _{o}}\frac{q}{r^{2}}\Delta
A\cos \theta \\
&=&\frac{q}{4\pi \varepsilon _{o}}\frac{\Delta A\cos \theta }{r^{2}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
but 
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\Delta A\cos \theta }{r^{2}}=\Delta \Omega
\end{equation*}%
is the solid angle subtended by the projected area. Then 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta \Phi _{E}=\frac{q}{4\pi \varepsilon _{o}}\Delta \Omega

The total flux though the oddly shaped closed surface is then%
\begin{equation*}
\Phi _{E}=\frac{q}{4\pi \varepsilon _{o}}\doint d\Omega

where we integrate over the entire arbitrary surface, $S$. 
\begin{equation*}
\Phi _{E}=\frac{q}{4\pi \varepsilon _{o}}\doint_{S}d\Omega
\end{equation*}%
but by definition%
\begin{equation*}
\doint_{S}d\Omega =4\pi \unit{sr}
\end{equation*}%
so%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Phi _{E} &=&\frac{q}{4\pi \varepsilon _{o}}\doint_{S}d\Omega \\
&=&\frac{q}{4\pi \varepsilon _{o}}4\pi \unit{sr} \\

which is just Gauss' law.

So far we have used mostly charged insulators to find fields. But we know we
will be interested in conductors and their fields in building electronics.
We will take up the study of charged conductors and their fields next.

\section{Conductors in Equilibrium}

Conductors have some special properties because they have movable charge.
Here they are

\begin{enumerate}
\item Any excess static charge (charge added to an uncharged conductor) will
stay on the surface of the conductor.

\item The electric field is zero everywhere \emph{inside} a conductor.

\item The electric field just outside a charged conductor is perpendicular
to the conductor surface.

\item Charge tends to accumulate at sharp points where the radius of
curvature of the surface is smallest.
\end{enumerate}

It is our job to convince ourselves that these are true. Lets take these one
at a time.

\subsection{In Equilibrium, excess charge is on the Surface}

Let's think about what we know about conductors. Most good conductors are
metals. The reason they are good conductors is that the outer electrons in
metals are in open valence bands where there are many energy states
available to the electrons. These electrons are free to travel around. This
means that if we place a charge near a metal object, the free charges will
experience an acceleration. Of course, the charge does not fly out of the
conductor. It will have to stop when it reaches the end of the metal object.
Suppose we go back to our experiment from the first lecture. We took a
charged rod, and placed it near an uncharged conductor.

}The free electrons moved. We ended up with a bunch of electrons all on the
right hand side. They all repel each other. So at some point the force
between a free electron and the charged rod, and the force between a free
electrons and the rest of the free electrons will balance. At that point,
there is zero net force (think of Newton's second law). The free electrons
stop moving. We have a word from PH121 or Statics for when all the forces
balance. We say the charges are in \emph{equilibrium}.

Now suppose we have a conductor just on it's own and suppose we add charge
to it. Where would the extra charge go? \ We have considered this before. In
the picture below, I have a spherical conductor with two extra negative
charges shown. The pair of charges will repel each other. Now because of the 
$r^{2}$ in our electric force equation, the closer the extra charges are,
the stronger the repulsive force. The result is that they will try to go as
far from each other as possible. So the extra charge on a spherical
conductor will all end up on the surface. \FRAME{dhF}{0.921in}{0.8752in}{0pt%

We can use Gauss' law to find the field in a conductor. We know that the
extra charge will all be on the surface if there is no electric current.

surface, to match the symmetry of the conductor. What is the charge inside?
It is zero, since the reaming charge is all bound up in atoms and balances
out. Since there is no net charge, there is no net flux. If there is no
flux, there is no net field inside a conductor that is in static equilibrium.

Note that if we connected this conductor to both ends of a battery, we would
have a field in the conductor, so we must remember that static equilibrium
is a special case.

If we don't connect the conductor to the ground or a battery, we can say: 
\emph{The net electric field is zero everywhere inside the conducting
material.}

Consider if this were not true! If there were an electric field inside the
conductor, the free charge there would accelerate and there would be a flow
of charge. If there were a movement of charge, the conductor would not be in
equilibrium. Suppose we place a brick of conductor in a field. We expect
that the charges will be accelerated. Negative charges will move opposite
the field direction. We end up with the situation shown in the next figure.%

the other side has a net positive charge. This separation of the charges
creates a new field in the opposite direction of the original field. In
equilibrium, just enough charge is moved to create a field that cancels the
original field.

Suppose we have a conductor in equilibrium. We can now ask, what does it
mean that the charge is \textquotedblleft on the surface?\textquotedblright\
Is there a small distance within the metal where we would find extra charge?
or is it all right at the edge of the metal?

Let's look at this again now that we know Gauss' law. Let's envision a
conducting object with a matching Gaussian surface.

\FRAME{dhF}{1.9424in}{2.2329in}{0in}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

conductor is zero. So no field lines can leave or enter the Gaussian
surface. So no charge can be inside or we would have a net flux, and,
therefor, a field. We can move the Gaussian surface from the center of the
conductor and grow it until it is just barely smaller than the surface of
the conductor, and there still must be no field, so no charge inside. \FRAME{%

We can make this Gaussian surface as close to the actual surface as we like,
and still there must be no field inside. Thus all the excess charge must be
on the surface. It is not distributed at any depth in the material.

In the following picture, we can see that the field lines seem to leave the
surface of these charged conductors at right angles (remember that sometimes
we call this \emph{normal} to the surface). \FRAME{dhF}{1.9268in}{1.6924in}{%

component of the field in such a case. The component of the field along the

force to the left. This force would rearrange the charge until there was no
force. But since $F_{x}=qE_{x}$, then when $F_{x}$ is zero, so is $E_{x}.$
Suppose we place a conductor in an external field. We would see that the
charges within the conductor will rearrange themselves until the field lines
will leave perpendicular to the surface of the conductors.

\FRAME{dhF}{3.4861in}{2.3462in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

Notice the square box in the last figure. There is an opening inside the
conductor, but there is no net field inside. The conductor charges rearrange
themselves so that the external field is canceled out. This is part of what
is known as a \emph{Faraday cage} which allows us to cancel out an external
electric field. This is used to protect electronic devices that must operate
in strong electric fields. To complete the effect, we will also need to show
that magnetic fields are canceled by such a conducting box.

We should also consider what happens when we place a charge in a conductive
container. Does this charge get screened off?

"1";cropright "1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename
'N8ESCF4O.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}In this case, the answer is no.
The charges in the conductor will move because of the charge contained
inside the conducting container. The negative charge will move in the case
shown, and it will move to the outside of the container surface. This leaves
positive charges behind on the inner surface. We know that there will be no
field inside the conductor, but think of placing a Gaussian surface around
all of the container and charge. There will be a net charge inside the
Gaussian surface, so there will be a field. The inner surface charge does
cancel the charge from the charged sphere. But the negative charge on the
conductor surface creates a new field.

\subsection{Charge tends to accumulate at sharp points}

Let's go back to our charged conductor. Notice that the field lines bunch up
at the corners! Where the field lines are closer together, there must be
more charge and the field strength must be higher.\FRAME{dhF}{2.041in}{%

to move. To see how this happens, let's review energy.

\begin{equation}
W_{nc}=\Delta K+\Delta U
\end{equation}

We started with gravitational potential energy, and, as we found
conservative forces, we defined new potential energies to describe the work
done by those forces. For example, we added spring potential energy%
\begin{equation}
W_{nc}=\Delta K+\Delta U_{g}+\Delta U_{s}
\end{equation}%
I bet you can guess what we will do with our electrical or Coulomb force!%
\begin{equation}
W_{nc}=\Delta K+\Delta U_{g}+\Delta U_{s}+\Delta U_{C}
\end{equation}%
When we do this, we mean that the work done by the Coulomb force $\left(
W_{C}\right) $ is the negative of the electrical potential energy change%
\begin{equation}
W_{C}=-\Delta U_{C}
\end{equation}%
and we are saying that the Coulomb force is conservative.

Remember that the equation for the force due to gravity and the equation for
the Coulomb force are very alike. So we might guess that the Coulomb force
is conservative like gravity--and we would be right!

Let's use our Coulomb force to calculate work. I\ would like a simple
example, so let's assume we have a uniform electric field. We know that we
can almost really make a uniform electric field by building a large
capacitor.\FRAME{dhF}{3.6763in}{1.4512in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

We draw some field lines (from the + charges to the - charges). The field
lines will be mostly straight lines in between the plates. Of course,
outside the plates, they will not be at all straight, but we will ignore
this because we want to calculate work just in the uniform part of the field.

I want to place a charge, $q,$ in this uniform field. The charge will
accelerate. Work will be done. I want to find out how much work is done on
the charge.

From our PH121 or Dynamics experience, we know that 
\begin{eqnarray}
W &=&\int \overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}\cdot \mathbf{d}\overrightarrow{\mathbf{%
x}} \\
&=&F\Delta x\cos \theta  \notag
\end{eqnarray}%
for constant forces. Because we have a constant field, we will have a
constant force.

I will choose the $x$ direction to be vertical and $x=0$ to be near the
positive plate. Then we can write the force due to the electric field as%
\begin{eqnarray*}
W &=&F\Delta x\cos \theta \\
&=&\left( q_{m}E\right) \Delta x\cos \left( 0\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{b0}}%
%BeginExpansion
{{}^\circ}%
%EndExpansion
}\right) \\
&=&q_{m}E\Delta x
\end{eqnarray*}

If there are no non-conservative forces, and we ignore gravity, then we can
say%
%TCIMACRO{%
%\TeXButton{Far Board}{\marginpar {

0 &=&\Delta K+0-qE\Delta x
\end{eqnarray*}%
so 
\begin{equation}
\Delta K=q_{m}E\Delta x
\end{equation}

This is very interesting! This means that for this simple geometry I\ could
ask you questions like, \textquotedblleft after the charge travels $\Delta
x, $ how fast is it going?\textquotedblright

\subsection{Electric and Gravitational potential energy compared}

We have found that the potential energy for the Coulomb force is given by%
\begin{equation*}
\Delta U_{C}=-q_{m}E\Delta x
\end{equation*}%
for a \emph{uniform} electric field (it will change for non-uniform fields).
Let's compare this to the gravitational potential energy%
\begin{equation*}
\Delta U_{g}=-mgh
\end{equation*}%
Let's set up a situation where the electric field and gravitational field
are almost uniform and we have a positively charged particle with charge $%
q_{m}$ and mass $m.$ The height, $h,$ we will call $d$ to match our
gravitational and electrical cases.\FRAME{dhF}{3.4281in}{2.0487in}{0pt}{}{}{%

'N8ESCF4R.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}

The gravitational potential difference is 
\begin{equation}
\Delta U_{g}=-mgd
\end{equation}%
and the electrical potential difference is%
\begin{equation}
\Delta U_{C}=-q_{m}Ed
\end{equation}%
These equations look a lot alike. We should expect that if we push the
charge $q_{m}$ \textquotedblleft up,\textquotedblright\ we will increase
both potential energies. We will have to do positive work to do that $\left(
W=-\Delta U\right) .$ This is just like doing work in a gravitational field,
so we are familiar with this behavior.

There is a difference, however. We have assumed that our charge $q_{m}$ was
positive. Suppose it is negative? There is only one kind of mass, but we
have two kinds of charge. We will have to get used to negative charges
\textquotedblleft falling up\textquotedblright\ to make the analogy continue.

This analogy helps us to understand how the electric potential energy will
act, and we will continue to use it. There is a difficulty, however, in that
most engineering classes only study gravitation in nearly uniform
gravitational fields. But if we look at large objects (like whole planets)
that are separated from other objects by some distance, then we have very
non-uniform gravitational fields. Unless you are an aerospace engineer,
these cases are less common. So to help us understand electric potential
energy, we will study gravitational potential energy of large things first,
then study the energy associated with individual charges and their very
non-uniform fields. We will take this on next time.

As we said last lecture, we want to use gravitation as an analogy for the
electric potential energy. Gravitation is more intuitive. But chances are
gravitation of whole planets was not stressed in Dynamics (If you took PH121
you should be fine, and this will be a review). So let's take a few moments
out of a PE101 class (introductory planetary engineering\footnote{%

Long, long ago you studied the potential energy of objects in what we can
now call the Earth's gravitational field.

The presentation of the idea of potential energy likely started with 
\begin{equation*}
U_{g}=mgy
\end{equation*}%
where $m$ is the mass of the object, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity,
and $y$ is how high the object is compared to a $y=0$ point. If you recall,
we got to pick that $y=0$ point. It could be any height.

Notice as well that this contains the properties of the mover object, $m,$
and the properties of the environment or gravitational field, $g.$

This all works fairly well so long as we take fairly small objects near the
much larger Earth. But hopefully you also considered objects farther away
from the Earth's surface, or larger objects like the moon. For these
objects, $mgy$ is not enough to describe the potential energy. The reason is
that if we are far away from the center of the Earth we will notice that the
Earth's gravitational field is not uniform. It curves and diminishes with
distance. So, if an object is large, it will feel the change in the
gravitational field over its (the object's) large volume.

We have the tools to find the potential energy of this situation. We know
that a change in potential energy is just an amount of work%
\begin{equation*}
\Delta U_{g}=-W_{g}=-\int \overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{g}\cdot d%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{r}}
\end{equation*}%
The magnitude of the gravitational force is 
\begin{equation*}
F_{g}=G\frac{M_{E}m_{m}}{r_{Em}^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
where $M_{E}$ is the mass of the Earth, $m_{m}$ is the mass of the mover
object, and $r_{Em}$ is the distance between the two. The constant, $G,$ is
the gravitational constant.\FRAME{dtbpF}{3.8623in}{1.1986in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure%

The field is radial, so $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{g}\cdot d%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{r}}=-Fdr$ for the configuration we have shown, and
we can perform the integration. Say we move the object a distance $\Delta r$
away were%
\begin{equation*}
\Delta r=R_{2}-R_{1}
\end{equation*}%
and $\Delta r$ is large, comparable to the size of the Earth or larger. Then 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta U_{g} &=&-\int_{R_{1}}^{R_{2}}\left( -G\frac{M_{E}m_{m}}{r^{2}}%
\right) dr \\
&=&GM_{E}m_{m}\int_{R_{1}}^{R_{2}}\frac{dr}{r^{2}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
where $R$ is the distance from the center of the Earth to the center of our
object.%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta U_{g} &=&GM_{E}m_{m}\int_{R_{1}}^{R_{2}}\frac{dr}{r^{2}} \\
&=&GM_{E}m_{m}\left[ -\frac{1}{r}\right\vert _{R_{1}}^{R_{2}} \\
&=&GM_{E}m_{m}\left[ -\frac{1}{R_{2}}-\left( -\frac{1}{R_{1}}\right) \right]
\\
&=&-GM_{E}m_{m}\left[ \frac{1}{R_{2}}-\frac{1}{R_{1}}\right] \\
&=&-G\frac{M_{E}m_{m}}{R_{2}}+G\frac{M_{E}m_{m}}{R_{1}}
\end{eqnarray*}

We recall that we need to set a zero point for the potential energy. Before,
when we used the approximation $m_{m}gy$ we could choose $y=0$ anywhere we
wanted. But now we see an obvious choice for the zero point of the potential
energy. If we let $R_{2}\rightarrow \infty $ and then the first term in our
expression will be zero. Likewise, of we let $R_{1}\rightarrow \infty $ the
second term will be zero. It looks like as we get infinitely far away from
the Earth, the potential energy naturally goes to zero! Mathematically this
makes sense. But we will have to interpret what this choice of zero-point
means.

But first, let's see how much work it would take to move the moon out of
obit and move it farther away. Say, from $R_{1,}$ the present orbit radius,
to $R_{2}=2R_{1},$ or twice the original orbit distance. Then%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta U_{g} &=&U_{2}-U_{1}=-G\frac{M_{E}m_{m}}{2R_{1}}+G\frac{M_{E}m_{m}}{%
R_{1}} \\
&=&G\frac{M_{E}m_{m}}{R_{1}}\left( -\frac{1}{2}+1\right) \\
&=&\left( \frac{1}{2}\right) G\frac{M_{E}m_{m}}{R_{1}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
The change is positive. We gained potential energy as we went farther from
the Earth's surface. That makes sense! That is analogous to increasing $y$
in $mgy.$ The potential energy also gets larger if the mass of our object
(like the moon or a satellite) gets larger. Again that makes sense because
in our more familiar approximation the potential energy increases with mass.
So this new form for our equation for potential energy seems to work.

But what does it mean that the potential energy is zero infinitely far away?
Recall that a change in potential energy is an amount of work%
\begin{equation*}
W=-\Delta U
\end{equation*}%
Usually we will consider the potential energy to be the amount of work it
takes to bring the test mass $m_{o}$ from infinitely far away (our zero
point!) to the location where we want it. It is how much energy is stored by
having the object in that position. Like how much energy is stored by
putting a mass high on a shelf. For example we could bring the moon in from
infinitely far away. Then 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta U_{g} &=&U_{2}-U_{1}=-G\frac{M_{E}m_{m}}{R_{2}}+G\frac{M_{E}m_{m}}{%
\infty } \\
U_{2} &=&-G\frac{M_{E}m_{m}}{R_{2}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
This is how much potential energy the moon has as it orbits the Earth
because it is high, above the Earth. But notice, this is a negative number!
What can it mean to have a negative potential energy?%

We use this convention to indicate that the test mass, $m_{m}$ is bound to
the Earth. It would take an input of energy to get the moon free from the
gravitational pull of the Earth. Here is the Moon potential energy plotted
as a function of distance. \FRAME{dtbpFX}{4.4996in}{1.9865in}{0pt}{}{}{Plot}{%

infinite distance to overcome the Earth's gravity completely. That makes
sense from our force equation. The force only goes to zero infinitely far
away. When we finally get infinitely far away, there will be no potential
energy due to the gravitational force because the gravitational force will
be zero.

Of course, there are more than just two objects (Earth and Moon) in the
universe, so as we get farther away from the Earth, the gravitational pull
of, say, a galaxy, might dominate. So we might not notice the weak pull of
the Earth as we encounter other nearrer objects.

We should show that this form for the potential energy due to gravity
becomes the more familiar $m_{m}gh$ if our distances are small compared to
the Earth's radius.

Let our distance from the center of the Earth be $R_{2}=R_{E}+y$ where $%
R_{E} $ is the radius of the Earth and $y\ll R_{E}$. Then 
\begin{eqnarray*}
U &=&-G\frac{M_{E}m_{m}}{R_{2}} \\
&=&-G\frac{M_{E}m_{m}}{R_{E}+y}
\end{eqnarray*}%
We can rewrite this as 
\begin{eqnarray*}
U &=&-G\frac{M_{E}m_{m}}{R_{E}\left( 1+\frac{y}{R_{E}}\right) } \\
&=&-G\frac{M_{E}m_{m}}{R_{E}}\left( 1+\frac{y}{R_{E}}\right) ^{-1}
\end{eqnarray*}%
Since $y$ is small $y/R_{E}$ is very small and we can approximate the therm
in parenthesis using the binomial expansion%
\begin{equation*}
\left( 1\pm x\right) ^{n}\approx 1\mp nx\qquad \text{if }x\ll 1
\end{equation*}%
then we have%
\begin{equation*}
\left( 1+\frac{y}{R_{E}}\right) ^{-1}\approx 1-\left( -1\right) \frac{y}{%
R_{E}}\qquad \text{if }\frac{y}{R_{E}}\ll 1
\end{equation*}%
and our potential energy is%
\begin{equation*}
U=-G\frac{M_{E}m_{m}}{R_{E}}\left( 1+\frac{y}{R_{E}}\right)
\end{equation*}%
then 
\begin{eqnarray*}
U &=&-G\frac{M_{E}m_{m}}{R_{E}}+G\frac{M_{E}m_{m}y}{R_{E}^{2}} \\
&=&U_{o}+m_{m}\left( G\frac{M_{E}}{R_{E}^{2}}\right) y
\end{eqnarray*}%
If we realize that $U_{o}$ is the potential energy of the object at the
surface of the Earth, then the change in potential energy as we lift the
object from the surface to a height $y$ is 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta U &=&\left( U_{o}+m_{m}\left( G\frac{M_{E}}{R_{E}^{2}}\right)
y-\left( U_{o}+m_{m}\left( G\frac{M_{E}}{R_{E}^{2}}\right) \left( 0\right)
\right) \right) \\
&=&m_{m}\left( G\frac{M_{E}}{R_{E}^{2}}\right) y
\end{eqnarray*}%
All that is left is to realize that 
\begin{equation*}
\left( G\frac{M_{E}}{R_{E}^{2}}\right)
\end{equation*}%
has units if acceleration. This is just $g$%
\begin{equation*}
g=\left( G\frac{M_{E}}{R_{E}^{2}}\right)
\end{equation*}%
so we have 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta U=m_{m}gy
\end{equation*}%
and there is no contradiction. But we should realize that this is an
approximation. The more accurate version of our potential energy is 
\begin{equation*}
U_{2}=-G\frac{M_{E}m_{m}}{R_{2}}
\end{equation*}%
More importantly, we see that the field property, $g,$ is being created by $%
M_{E}$ because $M_{E}$ is part of the defining equation.

Likewise we should expect that for charges 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta U_{C}=-q_{m}Ed
\end{equation*}%
is an approximation that is only good when the field, $E$, can be
approximated as a constant magnitude and direction and that the distribution
of charge, $q,$ is not spatially too big. With this understanding, we can
understand electrical potential energy of point charges.

\subsection{Point charges potential}

Suppose we now take a positive charge and define it's position as $r=0$ and
place a negative mover charge near the positive charge. \FRAME{dhF}{4.4166in%

the charge a distance $\Delta r=R_{2}-R_{1}$ would be%
\begin{equation*}
\Delta U_{e}=-W_{e}=-\int \overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{e}\cdot d%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{r}}
\end{equation*}%
The magnitude of the electrical force is 
\begin{equation*}
F_{e}=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{Q_{E}q_{m}}{r^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
once again $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{e}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{r}}
$ $=-F_{e}dr$ and 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta U_{e} &=&-\int_{R_{1}}^{R_{2}}\left( -\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}%
\frac{Q_{E}q_{m}}{r^{2}}\right) dr \\
&=&\frac{Q_{E}q_{m}}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\int_{R_{1}}^{R_{2}}\frac{dr}{r^{2}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
and we realize that this is exactly the same integral we faced in the
gravitational case. The answer must be 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta U_{e}=-\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{Q_{E}q_{m}}{R_{2}}+\frac{1}{%
4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{Q_{E}q_{m}}{R_{1}}
\end{equation*}

The similarity is hardly a surprise since the force equation for the Coulomb
force is really just like the force equation for gravity.

It makes sense to choose the zero point of the electric potential energy the
same way we did for the gravitational potential energy since the equations
is the same. We will pick $U=0$ at $r=\infty .$ Then we expect that 
\begin{equation*}
U_{e}=-\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{Q_{E}q_{m}}{r}
\end{equation*}%
is the electrical potential energy stored by having the charges in this
configuration.

Of course we remember that there is a large difference between electrical
and gravitational forces. If the two charges are the same sign, then they
will repel and the potential must be different for that situation. If we
redraw our diagram for this case, we realize that the sign of the force must
change.\FRAME{dhF}{4.4719in}{1.4088in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

energy gets larger as the two like charges get nearer. It takes energy to

Suppose we have three like charges. What will the potential energy of the
three-charge system be?

Let's consider the charges one at a time. If I move one charge, $q_{1},$
from infinitely far away. there is no environemntal field electric, so there
is no force, since we need two charges for there to be a force. Then there
is no potential energy. This is like a rock floating in deep space far away
from anything else in the universe. It just sits there, there is no
potential for movement, so no potential energy. But when we bring in another
charge, $q_{2},$ then $q_{1}$ is an environmental charge making a field and $%
q_{2}$ is our mover charge. Then $q_{2}$ will take an amount of work equal
to 
\begin{equation*}
U_{12}=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r_{12}}
\end{equation*}%
to move in the charge because the two charges repeal each other. There is a
force, so now there is an amount of potential energy associated with the
work done to move the charges together.

Suppose we had chosen to bring in the other charge, $q_{3},$ instead. Charge 
$q_{1}$ forms an envirnmental field. It takes an amount of energy 
\begin{equation*}
U_{13}=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{q_{1}q_{3}}{r_{13}}
\end{equation*}%
to bring in the third charge charge But if the second charge were already
there, the second charge also creates an environmental field, so it also
creates a force on the third charge. So it will take more work to bring in
the third charge.%
\begin{equation*}
U_{3}=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{q_{1}q_{3}}{r_{13}}+\frac{1}{4\pi
\epsilon _{o}}\frac{q_{2}q_{3}}{r_{23}}
\end{equation*}%
So the total amount of work involved in bringing all three charges together%
\begin{equation*}
U=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r_{12}}+\frac{1}{4\pi
\epsilon _{o}}\frac{q_{1}q_{3}}{r_{13}}+\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{%
q_{2}q_{3}}{r_{23}}
\end{equation*}%
then the potential energy difference would be 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta U &=&U_{f}-U_{i}=-W \\
&=&U_{f}-0 \\
&=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r_{12}}+\frac{1}{4\pi
\epsilon _{o}}\frac{q_{1}q_{3}}{r_{13}}+\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{%
q_{2}q_{3}}{r_{23}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
which we can generalize as 
\begin{equation*}
U=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\sum_{i<j}\frac{q_{i}q_{j}}{r_{ij}}
\end{equation*}%
for any number of charges. We simply add up all the potential energies. This
is one reason to use electric potential energy in solving problems. The
electric potential energies just add, and they are not vectors, so the
addition is simple.

\section{Dipole potential energy}

\FRAME{dhF}{2.655in}{1.8005in}{0in}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

Let's try out our new idea of potential energy for point charges on a
dipole. We will try to keep this easy, so let's consider the dipole to be in
a constant, uniform electric field. We know there will be no net force. The
work done to move a charge we have stated to be 
\begin{equation*}
W=\int \overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{e}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{r}}
\end{equation*}%
but in this case, we know the net force on the dipole is zero.

However, we can also do some work in rotating something%
\begin{equation*}
W_{rot}=\int \tau _{e}d\theta
\end{equation*}%
we know from before that the magnitude of the torque is 
\begin{equation*}
\tau =pE\sin \theta
\end{equation*}%
so%
\begin{eqnarray*}
W_{rot} &=&\int_{\theta _{1}}^{\theta _{2}}pE\sin \theta d\theta \\
&=&pE\left( \cos \theta _{2}-\cos \theta _{1}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}%
this must give 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta U &=&-W_{rot}=U_{f}-U_{i} \\
&=&-pE\left( \cos \theta _{2}-\cos \theta _{1}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}%
then we can write as 
\begin{equation*}
U=-pE\cos \theta
\end{equation*}%
This is the rotational potential energy for the dipole. We can write this as
an inner product 
\begin{equation*}
U=-\overrightarrow{\mathbf{p}}\cdot \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}
\end{equation*}%
What does this mean? It tells us that we have to do work to turn the dipole.

Let's go back to our example of a microwave oven. If the field is $E=200%
\unit{V}/\unit{m}$, then how much work does it take to turn the water
molecules?

Remember that the dipole moment for a water molecule is something like 
\begin{equation*}
p_{w}=6.2\times 10^{-30}\unit{C}\unit{m}
\end{equation*}%
so we have 
\begin{eqnarray*}
U &=&-\left( 6.2\times 10^{-30}\unit{C}\unit{m}\right) \left( 200\unit{V}/%
\unit{m}\right) \cos \theta \\

At zero degrees we can see that it takes energy (work) to make the dipole
spin. It will try to stay at zero degrees and a small displacement from zero
degrees will will cause the dipole to oscillate around $\theta =0$ but it
will return to $\theta =0$ as the added energy is dissipated. then $\theta =0%
\unit{rad}$ is a stable equilibrium. Conversely, at $\theta =\pi \unit{rad}$
we are at a maximum potential energy. We get rotational kinetic energy if we
cause any small displacement $\Delta \theta .$ The dipole will angularly
accelerate. $\theta =\pm \pi \unit{rad}$ is an unstable equilibrium.

\section{Shooting $\protect\alpha $-particles}

Let's use electric potentials to think about a famous experiment. Ernest
Rutherford shot $\alpha $-particles, $q=+2q_{e}$ at gold nuclei, $%
q=+79q_{e}. $ How close will the $\alpha $-particles get if the collision is
head-on and the initial speed of the $\alpha $-particles is $3\times 10^{6}%
\unit{m}/\unit{s}?$

The easiest way to approach this is to use conservation of energy. The
energies before and after must be the same because we have no frictional or
dissipative forces. The $\alpha $-particle, of course, is our mover.

The before and after pictures are as shown.\FRAME{dhF}{2.6135in}{1.9112in}{%

We can write 
\begin{equation*}
K_{i}+U_{i}=K_{f}+U_{f}
\end{equation*}%
when the $\alpha $-particles are at their closest distance to the gold
nuclei, then $K_{f}=0$. We can envision starting the $\alpha $-particles
from effectively an infinite distance away. Then $U_{i}\approx 0.$ so 
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{2}m_{\alpha }v^{2}=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{%
Q_{Au}q_{\alpha }}{r}
\end{equation*}%
Solving for $r$ gives%
\begin{eqnarray*}
r &=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{Q_{Au}q_{\alpha }}{\frac{1}{2}%
m_{\alpha }v^{2}} \\
&=&\frac{1}{2\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{\left( 79q_{e}\right) \left(
4q_{e}\right) }{m_{\alpha }v^{2}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
then%
\begin{eqnarray*}
r &=&\frac{1}{2\pi \left( 8.85\times 10^{-12}\frac{\unit{C}^{2}}{\unit{N}%
\unit{m}^{2}}\right) }\frac{158\left( 1.602\times 10^{-19}\unit{C}\right)
^{2}}{\left( 6.\,\allowbreak 642\,2\times 10^{-27}\unit{kg}\right) \left(
3\times 10^{6}\unit{m}/\unit{s}\right) ^{2}} \\
&=&1.\,\allowbreak 219\,8\times 10^{-12}\unit{m}
\end{eqnarray*}%
This is a very small number! and it sets a bound on how large the nucleus of
the gold atom can be.

Next lecture, we will try to make our use of electrical potential energy
more practical by defining the electrical potential energy per unit charge,
and applying this to problems involving moving charges (like those in
electric circuits).

\section{Electric Potential}

We defined electrical potential energy last time.%
\begin{equation*}
U_{e}=-\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{Q_{E}q_{m}}{r}
\end{equation*}%
This is a quantity that depends on two charges, the environmental charge $%
Q_{E}$ and the mover charge $q_{m}.$ This is a lot like electric force%
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{e}=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{Q_{E}q_{m}%
}{r^{2}}\mathbf{\hat{r}}
\end{equation*}%
If you will recall, we split the force into an environmental part and a
mover part%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{e} &=&q_{m}\left( \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}%
\frac{Q_{E}}{r^{2}}\right) \mathbf{\hat{r}} \\
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{e} &=&q_{m}\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
where $E$ is the electric field. We can do the same for the electric
potential energy%
\begin{equation*}
U_{e}=-q_{m}\left( \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{Q_{E}}{r}\right)
\end{equation*}%
where charge $q_{m}$ is our mover charge. By analogy, then 
\begin{equation*}
\left( \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{Q_{E}}{r}\right)
\end{equation*}%
must represent the environment set up by $Q_{E}.$ And sure enough, it has a $%
Q_{E}$ in it. But this does not have the units of electric field. So it must
be a new quantity. We will need a name for this new representation of the
environment created by $Q_{E}.$

Let's give a symbol and a name to our new environment quantity. 
\begin{equation*}
V_{E}=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{Q_{E}}{r_{Em}}
\end{equation*}%
where we understand that $Q_{E}$ is making the environment and we are
measuring that environment a distance $r_{Em}$ from $Q_{E}$ to the mover
charge $q_{m}.$

Then 
\begin{eqnarray*}
U_{e} &=&-q_{m}\left( \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{Q_{E}}{r}\right) \\
&=&-q_{m}\left( V_{E}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}%
It's traditional to drop the subscripts on the $V$ 
\begin{equation*}
V=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{q}{r}
\end{equation*}%
where we understand that an environmental charge labeled just $q$ is making
the environment and $r$ is a distance $r$ from $q$ to the location where we
want to know the environment. In that case we can write 
\begin{equation*}
U_{e}=q_{m}\left( V\right)
\end{equation*}%
or 
\begin{equation*}
V=\frac{U_{e}}{q_{m}}
\end{equation*}%
This new environment representation appears to be an amount of potential
energy per unit charge. In general any electrical potential energy $\left(
U\right) $ per unit charge $\left( q\right) $ is is called an \emph{electric
potential}. 
\begin{equation*}
V=\frac{U}{q}
\end{equation*}

This is a somewhat unfortunate name, because it sounds like electric
potential energy. But it is not, it is a representation of the environment
set up by the electric field. We don't get electric potential energy without
multiplying by a charge. $U=Vq_{o}.$ We can think of $U$ as the electrical
potential energy and $V$ as needing something beyond itself $\left( q\right) 
$ to be an electric potential energy, so it is just an electric potential
(no \textquotedblleft energy\textquotedblright\ in the name) because it
needs this extra piece.

\subsection{Electric Potential Difference}

We will give electric potential the symbol $V$ but usually the important
quantity is a change in potential energy, then 
\begin{equation}
\Delta V=\frac{\Delta U}{q}
\end{equation}%
If I\ know $\Delta V$ for a configuration of charge (like our capacitor
plates) then I\ can find the $\Delta U$ of different charges by multiplying
by the amount of charge in each case%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta U_{1} &=&q_{1}\Delta V \\
\Delta U_{2} &=&q_{2}\Delta V \\
&&\vdots
\end{eqnarray*}%
which is convenient if I\ am accelerating many different charges. We do this
in linear accelerators or \textquotedblleft atom smashers\textquotedblright\
so this is important to physicists! We can see that the units of $\Delta V$
must be 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\unit{J}}{\unit{C}}=\unit{V}
\end{equation}%
which has been named the \emph{Volt} and is given the symbol, $\unit{V}.$

Now this may seem familiar. Can you think of anything that carries units of
volts? Let's consider a battery. In our clickers we have $1.5$ volt
batteries. Inside the battery we would expect that a charge would experience
a potential energy difference. We buy the battery so we can convert that
potential energy into some other form of energy (radio wave energy for our
clickers). The potential energy achieved depends on the charge carrier. We
would have electrons in metals but we would have ions in a solution. This is
so convenient to express the potential energy per unit charge, that it is
the common form or expressing the energy given by most electrical sources.%

\subsection{Electric Potential}

Let's write out the electric potential difference between points $A$ and $B.$
It is the change in potential energy per unit charge as the charge travels
from point $A$ to point $B$ 
\begin{equation}
\Delta V=V_{B}-V_{A}=\frac{\Delta U}{q}
\end{equation}%
This is clearly a measure of how the environment changes along our path from 
$A$ to $B.$

Let's reconsider gravitational potential energy. We remember that if the
field is uniform (that is, if we are near the Earth's surface so the field
seems uniform) we can set the zero point of the potential energy anywhere we
find convenient for our problem, with the provision that once it is set for
the problem, we have to stick with our choice.

One logical choice for many electrical appliances is to set the Earth's
potential equal to zero. Note! this is not true for point mass problems
where we have already set the potential energy $U=0$ at $r=\infty .$ In our
gravitational analogy, this is a little bit like mean sea level. Think of
river flow. The lowest point on the planet is not mean sea level. But any
water above mean sea level will tend to flow downward to this point. Of
course, if we have land below mean sea level, the water would tend to
continue downward (like water flows to the Dead Sea). The direction of water
flow is given by the potential energy difference, not that actual value of
the potential energy. It is the same way with electric potential. If we have
charge at a potential that is higher than the Earth's potential, then charge
will flow toward the Earth.

Consider a $9\unit{V}$ battery. If the negative terminal is connected to a
grounding rod or metal water pipe, it will be at the electric potential of
the Earth while it's positive terminal will be at $\Delta V=9\unit{V}$ above
the Earth's potential. Likewise, in your home, you probably have a $110\unit{%
V}$ outlet. One wire is likely set to the potential of the Earth by
connecting it to a ground rod. The other is at $\Delta V=110\unit{V}$ above
it.

In our clickers, we don't have a ground wire, so we cannot guarantee that
the negative terminal of the battery is at the same potential as the Earth.
If our appliances in our house are not all grounded to the same potential,
there is a danger that there will be a large enough difference in their
potentials (think potential energy per unit charge) to cause the charges to
accelerate from one appliance to another. It is the difference in potential
that counts! This is a spark or shock that could hurt someone or damage
equipment. That is why we now use grounded outlets. These outlets have a
third wire that is tied to all the other outlet's third wire and also tied
physically to the ground near your house or apartment. This way, all
appliances are ensured to have the same low electric potential point.

\section{Example, potential of a capacitor}

Let's calculate the potential of our favorite device, the capacitor.

\FRAME{dhF}{2.693in}{3.3797in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

The nice uniform field makes this a useful device for thinking about
electric potentials. We have found that field to be%
\begin{equation*}
E=\frac{\eta }{\epsilon _{o}}
\end{equation*}%
with a direction from positive to negative. The work to push a mover charge
from one side to the other is given by 
\begin{equation*}
W=\int F_{e}\cdot dx
\end{equation*}%
The force is uniform since the field is uniform (near the middle at least) 
\begin{equation*}
F_{e}=q_{m}E
\end{equation*}%
then our work becomes 
\begin{eqnarray*}
W &=&\int q_{m}E\cdot dx \\
&=&q_{m}E\Delta x
\end{eqnarray*}%
and the amount of potential energy is 
\begin{equation*}
\left\vert \Delta U\right\vert =\left\vert -q_{m}E\Delta x\right\vert
\end{equation*}

We can set the zero potential energy point any where we want, but it is
tradition to set $U=0$ at the negative plate. If we do this we end up with
the potential energy difference going from the negative plate to the
positive plate being 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta U=q_{m}Ed
\end{equation*}%
Then if we go from the negative plate to the positive plate we have a
positive $\Delta U.$

We have seen all this before when we compared the electric potential energy
of a uniform gravitation field and a uniform electrical field. Now let's
calculate the electric potential difference 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=\frac{\Delta U}{q_{m}}=\frac{q_{m}Ed}{q_{m}}=Ed
\end{equation*}%
Remember that the field is created by the charges on the capacitor plates,
so it exists whether we put any $q_{o}$ inside of the capacitor or not. Then
the potential difference must exist whether or not there is a charge $q_{o}$
inside the capacitor.

You probably already know that a voltmeter can measure the electric
potential difference between two points, say, the plates of a capacitor. If
we use such a meter we could find the field inside the capacitor (well,
almost, remember our approximation is good for the center of the plates).%
\begin{equation*}
E=\frac{\Delta V}{d}
\end{equation*}

We need a way to envision this new environmental quantity that, like a
field, has a value throughout all space. Our analogy with gravity gives us
an idea. Suppose we envision the height potential energy as the top of a
hill. Then the low potential energy would be the bottom of the hill. We know
from our Boy Scout and Girl's Camp experiences how to show a change in
gravitational potential energy. We plot on a map lines of constant potential
energy. We call it constant elevation, but since near the Earth's surface $%
U_{g}=mgh$ the potential energy is proportional to the height, so we can say
these lines are lines of constant potential energy. Here is an example for
Mt. Shasta.\FRAME{dhFU}{4.3152in}{1.7669in}{0pt}{\Qcb{Map courtesy USGS,

We can think of these lines of constant potential energy as paths over which
the gravitational field does no work. If we walked along one of these lines
we would get neither higher nor lower and though we might do work to move us
to overcome some friction, the gravitational field would do no work. And we
would do no work in changing elevation.

Likewise we can draw lines of equal potential for our capacitor. When moving
along these lines the electric field would do no work. \FRAME{dhF}{2.4232in}{%

Notice that our equal potential lines are always perpendicular to the field.
From 
\begin{equation*}
W=\int q_{o}\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{x}}
\end{equation*}%
we can see that if the path we travel is perpendicular to the field, no work
is done. This is like us marching along around the mountain neither going up
nor down.

\section{Electron Volt}

Suppose I set up our uniform electric field device again\FRAME{dhF}{2.693in}{%

'N8ESCH55.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}We are not including any
gravitational field, so the directions involved are all relative to the
placement of the capacitor plate orientation.

This time, suppose I make the potential difference $\Delta V=1\unit{V}.$ I
release a proton near the high potential side. What is the kinetic energy of
the proton as it hits the low potential side? From the work energy theorem 
\begin{equation*}
W_{nc}=\Delta K+\Delta U
\end{equation*}%
and if we do this in a vacuum so there is no non-conservative work,%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta K &=&-\Delta U \\
K_{f}-K_{i} &=&-\Delta U \\
K_{f} &=&-\Delta U
\end{eqnarray*}

We can find the potential energy loss from what we just studied%
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=\frac{\Delta U}{q_{m}}
\end{equation*}%
so we can find the potential energy as%
\begin{equation*}
\Delta U=q_{m}\Delta V
\end{equation*}%
but remember we are going from a high to a low potential%
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=V_{f}-V_{i}
\end{equation*}%
this will be negative, so the potential energy change will be negative too.%
\begin{eqnarray*}
K_{f} &=&-\Delta U \\
&=&-q_{m}\Delta V
\end{eqnarray*}%
which will be a positive value (which is good, because I don't know what
negative kinetic energy would mean).%
\begin{equation*}
K_{f}=-q_{m}\Delta V
\end{equation*}%
We can find the amount of energy in Jules%
\begin{eqnarray*}
K_{f} &=&\left( 1.6\times 10^{-19}\unit{C}\right) \left( 1\unit{V}\right) \\
&=&\allowbreak 1.\,\allowbreak 6\times 10^{-19}\unit{J}
\end{eqnarray*}%
since we defined a volt as $\unit{V}=\frac{\unit{J}}{\unit{C}}$ .

You might think this is not very useful, but remember that $K=\frac{1}{2}%
mv^{2}.$ The kinetic energy is related to how fast the proton is going. In a
way, the kinetic energy tells us how fast the particle is going (we know
it's mass). If you read about the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, in
Switzerland the \textquotedblleft speeds\textquotedblright of the particles
will be given in energy units that are multiples of $\allowbreak
1.\,\allowbreak 6\times 10^{-19}\unit{J}.$ We call this unit an
electron-volt ($\unit{eV}$).\FRAME{dtbpFU}{2.3496in}{2.9368in}{0pt}{\Qcb{%

We can finish this problem by finding the speed of the particle%
\begin{equation*}
K=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}
\end{equation*}%
so%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{2K}{m}=v^{2}
\end{equation*}%
or%
\begin{eqnarray*}
v &=&\sqrt{\frac{2K}{m}} \\
&=&\sqrt{\allowbreak \frac{2\left( 1.\,\allowbreak 6\times 10^{-19}\unit{J}%

to provide a faster speed--faster than light! But with energies this high we
have to use Einstein's theory of Special Relativity to calculate the
particle speed. And, sadly, that is not part of this class. If you are
planning to work on the GPS\ system, or future space craft, you might need
to take yet another physics class so you can do this sort of calculation.

You might guess that we will want to know the electric potential of more
complex configurations of charge. We will take on this job in the next

\chapter{Electric potential of charges and groups of charges}

Now that we have a new representation of the environment created by
environmental charges, we will need to be able to calculate values for that
representation for different configurations of charge like we did for
electrical fields. But there is a huge benefit in using the electric
potential representation, electric potentials are not vectors! So we don't
have to deal with the vector nature of the field environment. The vector
nature is still there, but we will ignore it. This means we will give up
being able to give up vector directions for movement of our mover charges in
many cases. But we can know much about the movement and the equations will
be much simpler. We will take on the usual cases of environments from a
point charge, a collection of point charges, and a continuous distribution
of charges.

\section{Point charge potential}

The capacitor was an easy electric potential to describe. Let's go back to a
slightly harder one, the potential due to just one point charge. The
potential energy depends on two charges%
\begin{equation*}
U_{e}=-\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{Q_{E}q_{m}}{r}
\end{equation*}%
but the potential just depends on one.%
\begin{equation*}
V=\frac{U}{q_{m}}
\end{equation*}%
where $U$ is a function of $q_{m},$ so the mover charge will cancel.

We say we have an electric potential due to the environmental charge even if
the mover charge is not there. This is like saying there is a potential
energy per unit rock, even if there is no rock to fall down the hill. The
hill is there whether or not we are throwing rocks down it.

For electric potential, the potential is due to the field, and the field
from the environmental charge is there whether another charge is there or
not.

Let's find this potential due to just one charge, but let's find it in a way
that demonstrates how to find potentials in any situation. After all, from
what we know about point charges, we can predict that%
\begin{equation*}
V=\frac{U}{q_{m}}=\frac{\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{Q_{E}q_{m}}{r}}{%
q_{m}}=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{Q_{E}}{r}
\end{equation*}%
So finding the answer is not very hard. But not not all situations come so
easily. We only know forms for $U$ for capacitors and point charges so far.
So let's see how to do this in general, and compare our answer for the point
charge with what we have guessed from knowing $U$.

Symmetry tells us the field will be radial, so the equipotential surfaces
must be concentric spheres. Here is our situation:\FRAME{dtbpF}{2.0055in}{%

'N8ESCH58.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}We wish to follow the marked path
from $A$ to $B$ finding the potential difference $\Delta V=V_{B}-V_{A}.$

Remember that the field due to a charge $q$ is radially outward from the
charge. To find the potential we start with what we found last lecture, for
a constant field 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=\frac{\Delta U}{q_{m}}=\frac{q_{m}E\Delta s}{q_{m}}=E\Delta s
\end{equation*}%
where $s$ is the path length along our chosen path from $A$ to $B$. For our
capacitor, this was just the distance from one side to the other, but here
we need to be more general. We should really write this as 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot \overrightarrow{\Delta s}
\end{equation*}%
Further, our field, $E,$ changes, so technically this value for $\Delta V$
is not correct. But if we take vary small paths, $\Delta \overrightarrow{%
\mathbf{s}},$ then the field will be nearly constant over the small
distances. Then we can add up the contribution of each small distance, $%
\Delta \overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}_{i}$ to deal with the entire path from $A$
to $B$ for our point charge geometry. \FRAME{dtbpF}{2.1664in}{2.3186in}{0pt}{%

\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}_{i+1}$ and the next, until we have the
contribution of each pice of the path. We can call the contribution from one
piece. 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V_{i}=\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot \overrightarrow{\Delta s}_{i}

from trigonometry we can see that 
\begin{equation*}
\cos \phi =\frac{dr}{ds}
\end{equation*}%
(remember that $dr$ and $ds$ are lengths, infinitesimal lengths, but lengths
just the same) and 
\begin{equation*}

\begin{eqnarray*}

\end{eqnarray*}%
we get only a radial contribution since $\mathbf{\hat{r}}\cdot \mathbf{\hat{%
\theta}=0}$. Then 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}} &=&\frac{1}{%
4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{q_{E}}{r^{2}}\mathbf{\hat{r}}\cdot ds\cos \phi

&=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{q_{E}}{r^{2}}ds\cos \phi

where $\phi $ is the angle between $d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}$ and $%
\mathbf{\hat{r}}$ and where we recall that $\mathbf{\hat{r}}\cdot \mathbf{%

\begin{equation*}
dr=ds\cos \phi

we can eliminate $\phi $ from our equation%

Note that the potential depends only on the radial distances from the point
charge--not the path. We would expect this for conservative fields.

We know that, like potential energy, we may choose our zero point for the
electric potential. For a point charge, we often take the $r_{A}=\infty $
point as $V=0$. This is probably not a surprise, since $U\rightarrow 0$ when 
$r\rightarrow \infty .$ So you will often see the potential for the point
charge written as just%
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{q_{E}}{r_{B}}

It is probably a good idea to state that in common engineering practice we
kind of do all this backwards. We usually say we will charge up something
until it has a particular voltage. This is because we have batteries or
power supplies that are charge delivery services. They can provide enough
charge to make some object have the desired voltage. By \textquotedblleft
desired voltage\textquotedblright\ we always mean the voltage at the
conductor surface.

Early \emph{electrodes} were spherical, so let's consider making a spherical
conductor have a particular potential at it's surface. A sphere of charge
with radius $R$ would have 
\begin{equation*}
V=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{Q_{E}}{R}
\end{equation*}%
at it's surface. We can guess this because Gauss' law tells us that the
field of a charged sphere is the same as that of a point charge with the
same $Q.$ Then it takes 
\begin{equation*}
Q_{E}=4\pi \epsilon _{o}RV
\end{equation*}%
to get the voltage we want. The battery or power supply must provide this.
If the power supply or battery has a large amperage (ability to supply
charge) this happens quickly. But away from the electrode the potential
falls off. We can find how it falls off by again using 
\begin{equation*}
V=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{Q_{E}}{r}
\end{equation*}%
but with charge%
\begin{equation*}
Q_{E}=4\pi \epsilon _{o}RV_{o}
\end{equation*}%
so that%
\begin{equation*}
V=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{4\pi \epsilon _{o}RV_{o}}{r}
\end{equation*}%
or%
\begin{equation*}
V=\frac{R}{r}V_{o}
\end{equation*}%
where $V_{o}$ is the voltage at the surface. We can see that as $r$
increases, $V$ decreases.

We can guess from our treatment of the potential energy of two point charges
that the electric potential due to two point charges is just the sum of the
individual point charge potentials.%
\begin{eqnarray*}
V &=&V_{1}+V_{2} \\
&=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{q_{1}}{r_{1}}+\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon
_{o}}\frac{q_{2}}{r_{2}} \\
&=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\left( \frac{q_{1}}{r_{1}}+\frac{q_{2}}{r_{2}}%
\right)
\end{eqnarray*}%
This is an environment created by two point charges. We could convert this
to a potential energy by introducing a mover charge, $q_{m}.$

\begin{equation*}
U=q_{m}\left( \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\left( \frac{q_{1}}{r_{1}}+\frac{%
q_{2}}{r_{2}}\right) \right)
\end{equation*}%
where both $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ are environmental charges.

It is instructive to look at the special case of two opposite charges (our
dipole). We can plot the electric potential in a plane through the two
charges. \FRAME{dhF}{1.6516in}{2.2911in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

Suppose we have many point charges. What is the potential of the group? We
just use superposition and add up the contribution of each point charge%
\begin{equation}
V=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\dsum\limits_{i}\frac{q_{i}}{r_{i}}
\end{equation}%
where $r_{i}$ is the distance from the point charge $q_{i}$ to the point of
interest (where we wish to know the potential). Note that this is easier
than adding up the electric field contributions. Electric potentials are not
vectors! They just add as scalars.

Of course the electrical potential energy requires a mover charge. It would
be 
\begin{eqnarray*}
U &=&q_{m}\left( V\right) \\
&=&q_{m}\left( \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\dsum\limits_{i}\frac{q_{i}}{r_{i}%
}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

\section{Potential of groups of charges}

Suppose we have a continuous distribution of charge. Of course, this would
be made of many, many point charges, but if we have so many point charges
that the distance between the individual charges is negligible, we can treat
them as one continuous thing. If we know the charge distribution we can just
interpret the distribution as a set of small amounts of charge $dq$ acting
like point charges all arranged into some shape. \FRAME{dhF}{1.9285in}{%

have a small amount of potential%
\begin{equation}
dV=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{dq}{r}
\end{equation}%
and the total potential at some point will be the summation of all these
small amounts of charge 
\begin{equation}
V=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\int \frac{dq}{r}
\end{equation}%
This looks a little like our integral for finding the electric field from a
configuration of charge, but there is one large difference. There is no
vector nature to this integral. So our procedure will have one less step

\begin{itemize}
\item Start with $V=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\int \frac{dq}{r}$

\item find an expression for $dq$

\item Use geometry to find an expression for $r$

\item Solve the integral
\end{itemize}

Let's try one together

\subsection{Electric potential due to a uniformly charged disk}

We have found the field due to a charged disk. We can use our summation of
the potential due to small packets of charge to find the electric potential
of an entire charged disk.\FRAME{dtbpF}{4.3932in}{2.5625in}{0in}{}{}{Figure}{%

Suppose we have a uniform charge density $\eta $ on the disk, and a total
charge $Q$, with a disk radius $a.$ We wish to find the potential at some
point $P$ along the central axis.

To do this problem let's divide up the disk into small areas, $dA$ each with
a small amount of charge, $dq.$ 
%TCIMACRO{%
%\TeXButton{Question 223.31.5}{\marginpar {
%\hspace{-0.5in}

\small{Question 223.31.5}

%EndExpansion
The area element is 
\begin{equation*}
dA=rd\phi dr
\end{equation*}%
so the charge element, $dq,$ is 
\begin{equation*}
dq=\eta rd\phi dr
\end{equation*}

For each $dq$ we have a small part of the total potential. Let me use the
variable $R$ to be the distance from a part of the ring to the point $P.$
Then $R=\sqrt{r^{2}+z^{2}}$ and our integral becomes%
\begin{eqnarray*}
V &=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\int \frac{dq}{r} \\
&=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\int \int \frac{\eta rd\phi dr}{\sqrt{%
r^{2}+z^{2}}}
\end{eqnarray*}

We will integrate this. We will integrate over $r$ from $0$ to $a$ and $\phi 
$ from $0$ to $2\pi $ which will account for all the charge on the disk, and
therefore all the potential.

\begin{eqnarray}
V &=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\int_{0}^{2\pi }\int_{0}^{a}\frac{\eta 2\pi
rdr}{\sqrt{r^{2}+z^{2}}} \\
&=&\frac{\eta 2\pi }{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\int_{0}^{a}\frac{rdr}{\sqrt{%
r^{2}+z^{2}}}  \notag \\
&=&\frac{\eta 2\pi }{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\allowbreak \left. \sqrt{r^{2}+z^{2}}%
\right\vert _{0}^{a}  \notag \\
&=&\frac{\eta 2\pi }{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\allowbreak \sqrt{a^{2}+z^{2}}-\frac{%
\eta 2\pi }{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\allowbreak z  \notag
\end{eqnarray}%
so%
\begin{equation}
V=\frac{\eta }{2\epsilon _{o}}\left( \allowbreak \sqrt{a^{2}+z^{2}}%
-\allowbreak z\right)
\end{equation}%
This is the potential at point $P.$

We compared our electric field solutions with the solution for a point
charge. We can do the same for electric potentials. We can compare our
solution to a point charge potential for an equal amount of charge. Far away
from the disk, we expect the two potentials to look the same. The point
charge equation is%
\begin{equation*}
V=\frac{Q}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{1}{z}
\end{equation*}%
Our disk gives%
\begin{equation}
V=\frac{Q}{4\epsilon _{o}\pi }\frac{2}{a^{2}}\left( \allowbreak \sqrt{%
a^{2}+z^{2}}-\allowbreak z\right)
\end{equation}%
They don't look much alike! But plotting both yields

charge, the solid line is our disk with a radius of $0.05\unit{m}$ and a

is like a point charge, but close the two are quite different as we would
expect. This is a reasonable result.

We will calculate the potential due to several continuous charge
configurations.

But, you may ask, since we knew the field for the disk of charge, couldn't
we have found the electric potential from our equation of the field? We will
take up this question in the next two lectures.

The electric potential of a point charge is given by%
\begin{equation*}
V=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{Q}{r}
\end{equation*}%
where the zero potential point is set at $r=\infty .$

Electric potentials simply add, so the potential for a collection of point
charges is just%
\begin{equation*}
V=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\dsum\limits_{i}\frac{q_{i}}{r_{i}}

\chapter{Potential and Field}

Since electric fields and electric potentials are both representations of
the environment created by the environmental charge, there must be a way to
calculate the potential from the field and \emph{vice versa}. It will take
us two lectures to do both.

\end{itemize}

\section{Connecting potential and field}

It is time to pause and think about the meaning of this electric potential.
Let's trace our steps backwards. We defined the electric potential as the
potential energy per unit charge:%
%TCIMACRO{%

}%
%EndExpansion
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=\frac{\Delta U}{q_{m}}
\end{equation*}%
where $q_{m}$ is our mover and $\Delta V$ is a measure of the change in the
environment between two points $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$ measured from the
environmental charge. $\Delta U$ is the change in potential energy as $q_{m}$
moves. 
%TCIMACRO{%
%\TeXButton{Question 223.32.2}{\marginpar {

\marginpar {
\hspace{-0.5in}
\begin{minipage}[t]{1in}
\small{Question 223.32.2}
\end{minipage}
}
%EndExpansion
But the potential energy change is equal to the negative of the amount of
work we have done in moving $q_{m}$%
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=\frac{-W}{q_{m}}
\end{equation*}%
which is equal to 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=\frac{-1}{q}\int \overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{%
\mathbf{s}}
\end{equation*}%
where again $d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}$ is a general path length. But
this force was a Coulomb force. which we know is related to the electric
field%
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}=\frac{\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}}{q_{m}}
\end{equation*}%
so we may rewrite the potential as 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta V &=&-\int \frac{\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}}{q}\cdot d%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}} \\
&=&-\int \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
which we found last lecture by analogy with our capacitor potential. Our
line of reasoning in this lecture has been more formal, but we arrive at the
same conclusion--\textbf{and it is an important one!}%

If we add up the component of field magnitude times the displacement along
the path take from $r_{1}$ to $r_{2}$ we get the electric potential (well,
minus the electric potential).

The electric field and the electric potential are not two distinct things.
They are really different ways to look at the same thing--and that thing is
the environment set up by the environmental charge. It is tradition to say
the electric field is the principal quantity. This is because we have good
evidence that the electric field \emph{is} something. That evidence we will
study at the end of these lectures, but in a nutshell it is that we can make
waves in the electric field. If we can make waves in it, it must be
something!\footnote{%
By the end of these lectures, we will try to make this a more convincing
(and more mathmatical) statement!}

in our gravitational analogy, the gravitational field is the real thing.
Gravitational potential energy is a result of the gravitational field being
there. The change in potential energy is an amount of work, and the
gravitational force is what does the work. No force, no potential energy.
The gravitational field makes that force happen.

It is the same for our electrical force. The electrical potential is due to
the Coulomb force, and the Coulomb force exists because the electric field
is there.

If the field and the potential are really different manifestations of the
same thing, we should be able to find one from the other. We have one way to
do this. We can find the potential from the field, but we should be able to
find the field from the potential. We will practice the first%
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=-\int \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}
\end{equation*}%
today, and then introduce how to find the field from the potential next
lecture.

\subsection{Finding the potential from the field.}

Actually we did an example last lecture. We found the field of a point
charge. But let's take on some harder examples in this lecture.\FRAME{dhF}{%

Let's calculate the electric potential do to an infinite line of charge.
This is like the potential due to a charged wire. We already found the field
due to an infinite line of charge 
\begin{equation*}
E=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{2\lambda }{r}\mathbf{\hat{r}}
\end{equation*}%
so we can use this to find the potential difference.%
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=-\int_{A}^{B}\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{%
\mathbf{s}}
\end{equation*}%
We need $d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}.$ Of course $d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s%
}}$ could be in any direction. We can take components in cylindrical
coordinates%
\begin{equation*}
d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}=dr\mathbf{\hat{r}}+rd\theta \mathbf{\hat{\theta}%
}+dz\mathbf{\hat{z}}
\end{equation*}%
Putting in our field gives%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta V &=&-\int_{A}^{B}\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{2\lambda }{r}%
\mathbf{\hat{r}}\cdot \left( dr\mathbf{\hat{r}}+rd\theta \mathbf{\hat{\theta}%
}+dz\mathbf{\hat{z}}\right) \\
&=&-\frac{2\lambda }{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\int_{A}^{B}\frac{dr}{r}
\end{eqnarray*}%
which we can integrate%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta V &=&\left( -\frac{1}{2\pi }\frac{\lambda }{\epsilon _{o}}\ln
r_{B}-\left( -\frac{1}{2\pi }\frac{\lambda }{\epsilon _{o}}\ln r_{A}\right)
\right) \\
&=&-\frac{1}{2\pi }\frac{\lambda }{\epsilon _{o}}\left( \ln r_{B}-\ln
r_{A}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}%
This example gives us a chance to think about our simple geometries and to
consider when they are reasonable approximations to real charged objects. So
long as neither $r_{A}$ nor $r_{B}$ are infinite, this result is reasonable.
But remember what it looks like to move away from an infinite line of
charge. No matter how far away we go, the line is still infinite. So we
never get very far away. The terms 
\begin{equation*}
V_{A}=\frac{1}{2\pi }\frac{\lambda }{\epsilon _{o}}\left( \ln r_{A}\right)
\end{equation*}%
or%
\begin{equation*}
V_{B}=\frac{1}{2\pi }\frac{\lambda }{\epsilon _{o}}\left( \ln r_{B}\right)
\end{equation*}%
would look something like this\FRAME{dtbpFX}{4.4996in}{2.207in}{0pt}{}{}{Plot%

approaching zero as $r$ gets large. No matter how far we get from an
infinite line of charge, we really never get very far compared with it's
infinite length. So the potential is not going to zero!

Our solution is good only when $r_{A}$ and $r_{B}$ are much smaller than the
length of the line. that is, when our simple geometry is a good
representation for something that is real, in this case, a finite length
wire. But for $r_{A,}r_{B}\ll L$ this works.

We should also pause to think of the implications of this result for
electronic equipment design. Our result means that adjacent wires in a cable
or on a circuit board will feel a potential (in ME210 you called this a
voltage) due to their neighbors--something we have to take into
consideration in the design to ensure your equipment will work! This is one
reason why we use shielded cables for delicate instruments, and for data
lines, etc.

As a second example, let's tackle our friendly capacitor problem again. What
is the potential difference as we cross the capacitor from point $A$ to
point $B$? We already know the answer 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=Ed
\end{equation*}%
But when we found this before, we assumed we knew the potential energy. This
time let's practice using 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=-\int_{A}^{B}\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{%
\mathbf{s}}
\end{equation*}%
\FRAME{dhF}{2.4232in}{2.9136in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

\begin{equation*}
E=\frac{\eta }{\epsilon _{o}}
\end{equation*}%
so 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta V &=&-\int_{A}^{B}\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{%
\mathbf{s}} \\
&=&-\int_{A}^{B}\frac{\eta }{\epsilon _{o}}ds\cos \theta
\end{eqnarray*}%
where $\theta $ is the angle between the field direction and our $d%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}$ direction. We could write 
\begin{equation*}
dx=ds\cos \theta
\end{equation*}%
Then 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta V &=&-\frac{\eta }{\epsilon _{o}}\int_{A}^{B}dx \\
&=&-\frac{\eta }{\epsilon _{o}}\left( x_{B}-x_{A}\right) \\
&=&-\frac{\eta }{\epsilon _{o}}\Delta x
\end{eqnarray*}%
This is just 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=-E\Delta x
\end{equation*}%
if we consider the negative side to be the zero potential, and we cross the
entire capacitor, then 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta V &=&-E\left( x_{B}-x_{A}\right) \\
&=&-E\left( 0-d\right) \\
&=&Ed
\end{eqnarray*}%
as we expect. Note that we can now see how the positive result comes from
our choice of the zero voltage point.

We know that the electric potential comes from the electric field. And if we
think about it, we know where the electric field comes from, charge. But we
have found that equal amounts of positive and negative charge produce no net
field. So normal matter does not seem to have any net electric field because
the protons and electrons create oppositely directed fields, with no net
result.

But if we separate the positive and negative charges, we do get a field.
This is the source of all electric fields that we see, and therefore all
electric potentials are due to separated charge.

We have used charge separation devices already in our lectures. Rubbing a
rubber rod with rabbit fur transfers the electrons from the fur to the rod.
Some of the charges that were balanced in the fur are now separated. So
there is an electric field that creates an electric force. Then there must
be an electric potential, since the potential is just a manifestation of the
field.

We have also used a van de Graaff generator. It is time to see how this
works.\FRAME{dhF}{2.3372in}{2.5563in}{0in}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

In the base of the van de Graaff, there is a small electrode. It is charged
to a large voltage, and charge leaks off through the air to a rubber belt
that is very close. The rubber belt is connected to a motor. The motor turns
the belt. The extra charge is stuck on the belt, since the belt is not a
conductor. The charge is carried up to the top where there is a large round
electrode. A conducting brush touches the rubber belt, and the charge is
able to escape the belt through the conductor. The charge spreads over the
whole spherical electrode surface.

The belt keeps providing charge. Of course the new charge is repelled by the
charge all ready accumulated on the spherical electrode, so we must do work
to keep the belt turning and the charge ascending to the ball at the top.
This is a mechanical charge separation device. It can easily build potential
differences between the spherical top and the surrounding environment
(including you) of $30000\unit{V}$.

Much larger versions of this device are used to accelerate sub atomic
particles to very high speeds.

When you eat table salt, the NaCl ionic bond splits when exposed to polar
water molecules, leaving a positively charged Na ion and a negatively
charged Cl ion. This is very like the \textquotedblleft
bleeding\textquotedblright\ of charge from our charged balloons that we
talked about earlier. The water molecules are polar, and the mostly positive
hydrogens are attracted to the negatively charged Cl ions. This causes a
sort of tug-o-war for the Cl ions. The positively charged Na ions pull with
their coulomb force, and so do the positively charged hydrogens of the water
molecules. If we have lots of water molecules, they win and the NaCl is
broken apart. Water molecules are polar, but overall neutral. But now, with
the Na and Cl ions, we have separated charge. We can make this charge flow,
so we can get electric currents in our bodies. Our nervous system uses the
positively charged Na ions to form tiny currents into and out of neurons as
part of how nerve signaling works. Of course, NaCl is a pretty simple
molecule. We could use more complex chemical reactions to separate charge.

\section{Batteries and emf}

Most of us don't have a van de Graaff generator in our pockets. But most of
us do have a charge separation device that we carry around with us. We call
it a battery. But what does this battery do?

Somehow the battery supples positive charge on one side and negative charge
on the other side. This is accomplished by doing work on the charges. A lead
acid battery is often used in automobiles. The battery is made by suspending
two lead plates in a solution of sulfuric acid and water. \FRAME{dtbpF}{%

One plate is coated with lead dioxide. There is a chemical reaction at each

It also uses some some electrons from the lead plate. The PbO$_{2}$ splits

If we connect a wire between the plates, the extra electrons from one plate
will move to the other plate, and we have formed a current (something we
will discuss in detail later). Lead acid batteries are rechargeable. The
recharging process places an electric potential across the two lead plates,
and this drives the two chemical reactions backwards.

Now that we see that we can use chemistry to separate charge, let's think
about what this means for an electric circuit. 
\begin{equation*}
W_{chem}=\Delta U
\end{equation*}%
That work is equivalent to an amount of potential energy, so we have a
voltage. That voltage due to the separated charge is 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=\frac{W_{chem}}{q}
\end{equation*}%
This is not a chemistry class, so we won't memorize the chemical process
that does this. Instead, I would like to give a mechanical analogy. \FRAME{%

If we have water in a tank and we attach a pump to the tank, we can pump the
water to a higher tank. The water would gain potential energy. This is
essentially what a battery does for charge. A battery is sort of a
\textquotedblleft charge pump\textquotedblright\ that takes charge from a
low potential to a high potential.

The water in the upper tank can now be put to work. It could, say, run a
turbine.

If we had more batteries, we would have more potential difference. Each
battery \textquotedblleft pumping\textquotedblright\ the charge up to a
higher potential. Our analogy is not perfect, but it gives some insight into
why stringing batteries together increases the voltage. Our clickers use
three $1.5\unit{V}$ batteries for a total potential difference from the
bottom of the first to the top of the last of 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=3\times 1.5\unit{V}=4.\,\allowbreak 5\unit{V}
\end{equation*}

If you have been introduced to Kirchhoff's loop law, you may see this as
familiar. Kerchhoff said that 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V_{loop}=\sum_{i}\Delta V_{i}=0
\end{equation*}%
That is, if we go around a loop, we should end up at the same potential
where we started. This would be true for our plumbing example. If we start
at the lower tank, then travel through the pump to the upper tank, then
through the turbine to the lower tank we have 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta U_{total}=\Delta U_{pump}+\Delta U_{turbine}=0
\end{equation*}%
we are at the same elevation, we lost all the potential energy we gained by
being pumped up when we fell back down through the turbine.

Similarly, the battery pumps the charge up an amount $\Delta V_{bat}$ and it
\textquotedblleft falls\textquotedblright\ down an amount $\Delta V_{light}$
returning to where it started%
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V_{total}=\Delta V_{bat}+\Delta V_{light}
\end{equation*}%
This is just conservation of energy. As we go around the loop we must
neither create nor destroy energy. We can convert work into potential
through the pump or battery, then we can create movement of water or charge
and even useful work by letting the charge or water \textquotedblleft
fall\textquotedblright\ back down to the initial state. The change in energy
must be zero if there is no loss mechanism. Eventually we must allow some
loss to occur, but for now we have ideal batteries and wires and lights, so
energy is conserved.

We have a historic name for a charge pump like a battery. We call it an 
\emph{emf}. This is pronounced \textquotedblleft ee em
eff,\textquotedblright\ that is, we say the letters. Emf used to stand for
something, but that something has turned out to be a poor model for electric
current, but the letters describing a charge pump persist. This is a little
like Kentucky Fried Chicken changing it's name to KFC because now they bake
chicken (and no one wants to think about eating fried foods now days). The
letters are the name.

Next lecture we will complete our task. In this lecture we discussed finding
the potential if we know the field. Next lecture we will find out how to
calculate the field if we know the potential.

the field from the potential.

\section{Finding electric field from the potential}

We did part-one of relating fields to potentials in the last lecture. Now it
is time for part two, obtaining the electric field from a known potential.
Starting with 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=-\int_{A}^{B}\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{%
\mathbf{s}}
\end{equation*}%
we realize that we should be able to write the integrand as a small bit of
potential%
\begin{eqnarray*}
dV &=&-\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}} \\
&=&-E_{s}ds
\end{eqnarray*}%
where $E_{s}$ is the component of the electric field in the $\mathbf{\hat{s}}
$ direction. We can rearrange this 
\begin{equation*}
E_{s}=-\frac{dV}{ds}
\end{equation*}%
This tells us that the magnitude of our field is the change in electric
potential. Of course, $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}$ is a vector and $V$ is
not. So the best we can do is to get the magnitude of the component in the $%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}$ direction.

We can try this out on a geometry we know, say, a point charge along the $x$%
-axis\FRAME{dtbpF}{1.9112in}{1.6111in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

\begin{equation*}
V=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{q_{E}}{x}
\end{equation*}%
and we know the field is 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{q_{E}}{r^{2}}%
\mathbf{\hat{r}}
\end{equation*}%
then we can try 
\begin{eqnarray*}
E_{s} &=&-\frac{dV}{dx}=-\frac{d}{dx}\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{q_{E}%
}{x} \\
&=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{q_{E}}{x^{2}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
Since $r$ in the $x$ direction is just $x,$ this is just what we expected!%
\FRAME{dhF}{3.4947in}{2.0375in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

Let's try another. Let's find the electric field due to a disk of charge
along the axis. We have done this problem before. We know the field should
be 
\begin{equation}
E_{z}=2\pi k_{e}\eta \left( 1-\allowbreak \frac{z}{\sqrt{a^{2}+z^{2}}}\right)
\end{equation}%
and in the previous lectures we found the potential to be%
\begin{equation}
V=\frac{\eta }{2\epsilon _{o}}\left( \allowbreak \sqrt{a^{2}+z^{2}}%
-\allowbreak z\right)
\end{equation}

Now can we find the electric field at $P$ from $V?$ Let's start by finding
the $z-$component of the field, $E_{z}$%
\begin{eqnarray}
E_{z} &=&-\frac{dV}{dz} \\
&=&-\frac{d}{dz}\left( \frac{\eta }{2\epsilon _{o}}\left( \allowbreak \sqrt{%
a^{2}+z^{2}}-\allowbreak z\right) \right) \\
&=&-\frac{d}{dz}\frac{\eta }{2\epsilon _{o}}\allowbreak \sqrt{a^{2}+z^{2}}-%
\frac{d}{dz}k_{e}\sigma 2\pi z \\
&=&-\frac{\eta }{2\epsilon _{o}}\allowbreak \frac{d}{dz}\sqrt{a^{2}+z^{2}}%
+k_{e}\sigma 2\pi \\
&=&-\frac{\eta }{2\epsilon _{o}}\allowbreak \frac{z}{\sqrt{a^{2}+z^{2}}}%
+2\pi k_{e}\sigma \\
E_{z} &=&\frac{\eta }{2\epsilon _{o}}\left( 1-\allowbreak \frac{z}{\sqrt{%
a^{2}+z^{2}}}\right)
\end{eqnarray}%
or%
\begin{equation}
E_{z}=2\pi k_{e}\eta \left( 1-\allowbreak \frac{z}{\sqrt{a^{2}+z^{2}}}\right)
\end{equation}%
But remember that this situation is highly symmetric. We can see by
inspection that all the $x$ and $y$ components will all cancel out. So this
is our field! And it is just what we found before.

We can graph these functions to compare them (what would you expect?). To do
this we really need values, but instead, let's play a clever trick that some
of you will see in advanced or older books. I am going to substitute in
place of $z$ the variable $u=\frac{z}{a}.$ Then%
\begin{eqnarray*}
V &=&2\pi \eta k_{e}\left( \allowbreak \sqrt{a^{2}+z^{2}}-\allowbreak
z\right) \\
&=&2\pi a\eta k_{e}\left( \allowbreak \sqrt{1+\frac{z^{2}}{a^{2}}}%
-\allowbreak \frac{z}{a}\right) \\
&=&2\pi a\eta k_{e}\left( \allowbreak \sqrt{1+u^{2}}-\allowbreak u\right)
\end{eqnarray*}%
and 
\begin{eqnarray}
E_{z} &=&2\pi k_{e}\eta \left( 1-\allowbreak \frac{z}{\sqrt{a^{2}+z^{2}}}%
\right) \\
&=&2\pi k_{e}\eta \left( 1-\allowbreak \frac{z}{a\sqrt{1+\frac{z^{2}}{a^{2}}}%
}\right)  \notag \\
&=&2\pi k_{e}\eta \left( 1-\allowbreak \frac{z}{a\sqrt{1+\frac{z^{2}}{a^{2}}}%
}\right)  \notag \\
&=&2\pi k_{e}\eta \left( 1-\allowbreak \frac{\frac{z}{a}}{\sqrt{1+\frac{z^{2}%
}{a^{2}}}}\right)  \notag \\
&=&2\pi k_{e}\eta \left( 1-\allowbreak \frac{u}{\sqrt{1+u^{2}}}\right) 
\notag
\end{eqnarray}%
Both my equation for $V$ and for $E_{z}$ now are in the form of a set of
constants times a function of $u.$ 
\begin{eqnarray*}
V &=&2\pi a\eta k_{e}\left( \allowbreak \sqrt{1+u^{2}}-\allowbreak u\right)
\\
&=&2\pi a\eta k_{e}f\left( u\right)
\end{eqnarray*}%
\begin{eqnarray}
E_{z} &=&2\pi k_{e}\eta \left( 1-\allowbreak \frac{u}{\sqrt{1+u^{2}}}\right)
\notag \\
&=&2\pi k_{e}\eta g\left( u\right)
\end{eqnarray}%
If I plot $V$ in units of $2\pi a\sigma k_{e}$ (the constants out in front)
I can see the shape of the curve. It is the function of $f(u).$ I can
compare this to $E_{z}$ in units of $2\pi k_{e}\sigma .$ The shape of $E_{z}$
will be $g\left( u\right) .$ Of course we are plotting terms of $u.$ \FRAME{%

reasonable? Does it look like the $E$-field (red dashed line) is the right
shape for the derivative of the potential (solid green line)? It is also
comforting to see that as $u$ (a function of $z$) gets larger the field
falls off to zero and so does the potential as we would expect. When $V$
(green solid curve) has a large slope, $E_{z}$ is a large number (positive
because of the negative sign in the equation 
\begin{equation*}
E_{s}=-\frac{dV}{ds}
\end{equation*}%
and when $V$ is fairly flat, $E_{z}$ is nearly zero. Our strategy for
finding $E$ from $V$ seems to work.

\section{Geometry of field and potential}

You should probably worry that so far our equation 
\begin{equation*}
E_{s}=-\frac{dV}{ds}
\end{equation*}%
is only one dimensional. We know the electric field is a three dimensional
vector field. We may find situations where we need two or three dimensions.
But this is easy to fix. Our equation 
\begin{equation*}
E_{s}=-\frac{dV}{ds}
\end{equation*}%
gives us the field magnitude along the $\mathbf{\hat{s}}$ direction. Let's
choose this to be the $\mathbf{\hat{x}}$ direction. Then 
\begin{equation*}
E_{x}=-\frac{dV}{dx}
\end{equation*}%
is the $x$-component of the electric field. Likewise%
\begin{eqnarray*}
E_{y} &=&-\frac{dV}{dy} \\
E_{z} &=&-\frac{dV}{dz}
\end{eqnarray*}%
The total field will be the vector sum of it's components%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}} &=&E_{x}\mathbf{\hat{\imath}}+E_{y}\mathbf{\hat{%
\jmath}+}E_{z}\mathbf{\hat{k}} \\

The odd group of operations in the parenthesis is call a \emph{gradient} and
is written as 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{\nabla }}=\left( \frac{d}{dx}\mathbf{\hat{\imath}}+%
\frac{d}{dy}\mathbf{\hat{\jmath}+}\frac{d}{dz}\mathbf{\hat{k}}\right)
\end{equation*}%
using this we have%
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}=-\overrightarrow{\mathbf{\nabla }}V
\end{equation*}%
which is how the relationship is stated in higher level electrodynamics
books. But what does it mean?

The gradient is really kind of what it sounds like. If you go down a steep
grade, you will notice you are going down hill and will notice if you are
going down the steepest part of the hill. The gradient finds the direction
of steepest decent. That is, the direction where the potential changes
fastest. This is like looking from the top of the hill and taking the
steepest way down! Our relationship tells us that the electric field points
in this steepest direction, and the minus sign tells us that the electric
field points down hill away from a positive charge, never up hill (think of
the acceleration due to gravity being negative). Let's see if this makes
sense for our geometries that we know.%

Here is our capacitor. We see that indeed the field points from the high
potential to the low potential. The steepest way \textquotedblleft down the

We should try another example of finding the field from the gradient.

This example shows how to perform the operation, but it does not give much
insight. We have learned to work with our standard charge configurations,
and this is really not one of them. So we don't have much intuitive feel for
this electric field that we found.

To gain more insight, let's change back to one of our standard
configurations. let's return to finding the point charge field from the
point charge potential. The potential for a point charge is 
\begin{equation*}
V=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{Q}{r}
\end{equation*}%
And of course we know that the field is 
\begin{equation*}
E=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{Q}{r^{2}}\mathbf{\hat{r}}
\end{equation*}%
but we want to show this using 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}=-\overrightarrow{\mathbf{\nabla }}V
\end{equation*}

So%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}} &=&-\left( \frac{d}{dx}\mathbf{\hat{\imath}}+%
\frac{d}{dy}\mathbf{\hat{\jmath}+}\frac{d}{dz}\mathbf{\hat{k}}\right) V \\
&=&-\left( \frac{d}{dx}\mathbf{\hat{\imath}}+\frac{d}{dy}\mathbf{\hat{\jmath}%
+}\frac{d}{dz}\mathbf{\hat{k}}\right) \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{Q_{E}%
}{r}
\end{eqnarray*}%
but we know in Cartesian coordinates 
\begin{equation*}
r=\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
so%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}} &=&-\left( \frac{d}{dx}\mathbf{\hat{\imath}}+%
\frac{d}{dy}\mathbf{\hat{\jmath}+}\frac{d}{dz}\mathbf{\hat{k}}\right) \frac{1%

&=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{Q_{E}}{r^{2}}\mathbf{\hat{r}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
but really, this is a bit of a mess, we don't want to do such a problem in
rectangular coordinates. We could write $\mathbf{\nabla }$ in spherical
coordinates (something we won't derive here, but you should have seen in
M215 or M316). 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{\nabla }}=\mathbf{\hat{r}}\frac{\partial }{\partial r%
}+\mathbf{\hat{\theta}}\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial }{\partial \theta }+\mathbf{%
\hat{\phi}}\frac{1}{r\sin \theta }\frac{\partial }{\partial \phi }
\end{equation*}

Let's try this out on our point charge potential. We have 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}} &=&-\left( \mathbf{\hat{r}}\frac{\partial }{%
\partial r}+\mathbf{\hat{\theta}}\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial }{\partial \theta 
}+\mathbf{\hat{\phi}}\frac{1}{r\sin \theta }\frac{\partial }{\partial \phi }%
\right) V \\
&=&-\left( \mathbf{\hat{r}}\frac{\partial }{\partial r}+\mathbf{\hat{\theta}}%
\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial }{\partial \theta }+\mathbf{\hat{\phi}}\frac{1}{%
r\sin \theta }\frac{\partial }{\partial \phi }\right) \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon
_{o}}\frac{Q_{E}}{r} \\
&=&-\frac{Q_{E}}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\left( -\frac{1}{r^{2}}\mathbf{\hat{r}}%
+0+0\right) \\
&=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{Q_{E}}{r^{2}}\mathbf{\hat{r}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
just as we expected. But this time the math was much easier. If we can, it
is a good idea to match our expression for $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{\nabla }}
$ to the geometry of the system. A good vector calculus book or a compendium
of math functions will have various versions of $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{%
\nabla }}$ listed.

We know that there is no field inside a conductor in electrostatic
equilibrium, but we should ask what that means for the electric potential.
To build circuits or electronic actuators, we will need to know this. Let's
start again with%
\begin{equation}
\Delta V=-\int_{A}^{B}\mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{s}
\end{equation}%
and since the field $E=0$ inside the conductor, then inside 
\begin{equation}
\Delta V_{inside}=0
\end{equation}%
On the surface we see that there is a potential, since there is a field. If
we take our spherical case, \FRAME{dhF}{1.2436in}{1.1441in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{%
\special{language "Scientific Word";type "GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio

go away from the center, we expect the potential to be constant up to the
surface. Then as we reach the surface, we know from Gauss' law that the
field will be 
\begin{equation*}
E=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{Q_{E}}{r^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
like a point charge, so the potential at the surface must be%
\begin{equation*}
V=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{Q_{E}}{R}
\end{equation*}%
where $r=R,$ the radius of our sphere. As we move into the sphere from the
surface, the potential must not change. The interior will have the potential%
\begin{equation}
V_{inside}=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{Q_{E}}{R}
\end{equation}%
Outside, of course, the potential will drop like the potential due to a
point charge. We expect 
\begin{equation}
V=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{Q_{E}}{r}
\end{equation}%
For a sphere of radius $R=0.5\unit{m}$ carrying a charge of $0.000002\unit{C}
$ (about what our van de Graaff holds) we would have the situation graphed
in the following figure: \FRAME{dhF}{4.7143in}{3.3457in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{%
\special{language "Scientific Word";type "GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio
TRUE;display "USEDEF";valid_file "T";width 4.7143in;height 3.3457in;depth

"1";cropright "1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename
'N8ESCM69.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}This is an important point. For a
conductor, the electric potential everywhere inside the conductive material
is exactly the same once we reach equilibrium. This is just what we want for
capacitors or electrodes or electrical contacts in circuits.

\subsection{Non spherical conductors}

The field is stronger where the field lines are closer together. One way to
describe this is to use a radii of curvature. That is, suppose we try to fit
a small circle into a bump on the surface of a conductor. \FRAME{dtbpF}{%
4.5165in}{1.2152in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language "Scientific
Word";type "GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio TRUE;display "USEDEF";valid_file

"1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename 'N8ESCN6A.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}%
In the figure there are two bumps shown with circles fit into them. The bump
on the right has a much smaller radius circle than the one on the left. The
radius of the circle that fits into the bump is the radius of curvature of
the bump. From what we have said, the bump on the right will have a much
stronger field strength near it than the bump on the left.

Where there is a lot of charge on a conductor, and the field is very high,
electrons from random ionizations of air molecules near the conductor are
accelerated away from the conductor. These electrons hit other atoms,
ionizing them as well. We get a small avalanche of electrons. Eventually the
electrons recombine with ionized atoms, producing an eerie glow. This is
called \emph{corona discharge}. It can be used to find faults in high
tension wires and other high voltage situations.%

\subsection{Cavities in conductors}

Suppose we have a hollow conductor with no charges in the cavity. What is
the field? We know from using Gauss' law what the answer should be, but
let's do this using potentials.

\FRAME{dhF}{1.58in}{1.5074in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language "Scientific
Word";type "GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio TRUE;display "USEDEF";valid_file
"T";width 1.58in;height 1.5074in;depth 0pt;original-width

"1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename 'N8ESCN6B.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}%
All the parts of the conductor will be at the same potential. So let's take
two points, $A$ and $B,$ and compute%
\begin{equation*}
V_{A}-V_{B}=-\int_{A}^{B}\mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{s}
\end{equation*}%
We know that $V_{A}-V_{B}=0$ because $V_{A}$ must be the same as $V_{B}.$ So
for every path, $s,$ we must have%
\begin{equation*}
-\int_{A}^{B}\mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{s=0}
\end{equation*}%
We can easily conclude that $E$ must equal zero.

So as long as there are no charges inside the cavity, the cavity is a net
field free zone.

It is often much easier to find the potential, and from the potential, find
the field. Much of the study of electrodynamics uses this approach. This is
because it is more straight-forward to differentiate than it is to
integrate. Some of you may use massive computational programs to predict
electric fields. They often use differential equations in the potential to
find the field rather than integral equations to find the field directly.

\begin{itemize}
\item The charge on a capacitor is proportional to the potential difference $%
Q=C\Delta V$

\item The constant of proportionality is called the capacitance and for a
parallel plate capacitor, it is given by $C=\frac{A}{d}\epsilon _{o}$

\item In parallel capacitors capacitances add $C_{eq}=C_{1}+C_{2}$

\item In series capacitors capacitances combine as $\frac{1}{C_{tot}}=\frac{1%

\section{Capacitance and capacitors}

Consider the following design for a pump-tank system.\FRAME{dhF}{2.7851in}{%
3.3244in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language "Scientific Word";type

3.359in;cropleft "0";croptop "1";cropright "1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename
'N8ESCN6C.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}This is may not be an optimal
design. At first there is no problem, water flows into the upper tank just
fine. But once the upper tank begins to fill, the water already in the upper
tank will make it harder to pump in more water. As the tank fills, the
pressure at the bottom increases, and it takes more work for the pump to
overcome the increasing pressure.

Something analogous happens when a capacitor is connected to a battery. 
\FRAME{dhF}{4.7711in}{1.8857in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language
"Scientific Word";type "GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio TRUE;display

"1";cropright "1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename
'N8ESCN6D.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}

At first the charge is free to flow to the plates, but as the charge builds,
it takes more work to bring on successive charges.\FRAME{dhF}{4.9112in}{%
2.3611in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language "Scientific Word";type

2.3771in;cropleft "0";croptop "1";cropright "1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename
'N8ESCN6E.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}The charges repel each other, so
the charge already on a capacitor plate repels the new charge arriving from
the battery. The repelling force gets larger until finally the force
repelling the charge balances the force driving the charge from the battery
and the charge stops flowing onto the capacitor.

A capacitor is made from two plates. For us, let's assume they are
semi-infinte sheets of charge. Of course this is not exactly true, but it is
not too wrong near the center of the plates. And we know quite a lot about
semi-infinate sheets of charge because they are one of our standard change
configurations. We know the field for each sheet is 
\begin{equation*}
E=\frac{\eta }{2\epsilon _{o}}
\end{equation*}%
and that for two sheets, one with $+\eta $ and one with $-\eta $ the field
in between will be 
\begin{equation*}
E=\frac{\eta }{2\epsilon _{o}}
\end{equation*}%
We also know the potential difference between the two plates is just%
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=Ed
\end{equation*}%
where $E$ is our electric field and $d$ is the capacitor spacing.

We can guess that we will build up charge until the potential energy
difference of the capacitor is equal to the potential energy difference of
the battery%
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V_{capacitor}=\Delta V_{battery}
\end{equation*}%
because at that point the forces causing the potential energy will be equal.

We can write our electric field between the two plates as 
\begin{equation*}
E=\frac{\eta }{\epsilon _{o}}=\frac{Q}{A\epsilon _{o}}
\end{equation*}%
so 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=\frac{d}{A\epsilon _{o}}Q
\end{equation*}%
Then the potential difference is directly proportional to the charge. I\
want to switch this around, and solve for the amount of charge. 
\begin{equation*}
Q=\left( \frac{A\epsilon _{o}}{d}\right) \Delta V
\end{equation*}%
Since all the terms in the parenthesis are constants, we could replace them
with a constant, $C.$ 
\begin{equation}
Q=C\Delta V
\end{equation}%
where 
\begin{equation}
C=\frac{A}{d}\epsilon _{o}
\end{equation}%
is a constant that depends on the geometry and construction of the plates.
This equation tells us that if we build two different sets of plates, say,
one circular and one triangular, and we give them the same potential
difference (say, connect them both to $12\unit{V}$ batteries) then, if both
have the same construction constant $C,$ they will carry the same charge
even though their size and shape are different. We can reduce the burden of
calculation of how much charge a capacitor can hold but asking the person
who manufactured it to calculate the construction constant and mark the
value on the outside of the capacitor. Different capacitors may be
constructed differently (different $A$ or $d$ values) but so long as the
construction constant, $C,$ is the same, the charge amount for a given
voltage will be the same.

\subsection{Capacitors and sources of potential}

Consider what happens when we connect our two parallel plates to the
terminals of a battery. Assuming the plates are initially uncharged, charge
flows from the battery through the conducting wires and onto the plates.
Recall that for a metal, the entire surface will be at the same potential
under electrostatic conditions. The charge carriers supplied by the battery
will try to achieve electrostatic equilibrium, so we expect the plate that
is connected to the positive terminal of the battery to eventually be at the
same potential as the positive battery terminal. Likewise for the negative
terminal and the plate connected to it.

We can even use our capacitor as a source of electrical power. A camera
flash uses capacitors to make the burst of light that illuminates the
subject of your photo. In ME210 you should have studied RC circuits, so you
will understand that the battery is used to charge the capacitor and then a
switch is thrown to allow the charge to quickly leave through a different
circuit, making the flash. \FRAME{dhFU}{1.3941in}{1.7132in}{0pt}{\Qcb{Camera

\subsection{Single conductor capacitance}

Physicists can't leave a good thing alone. We often calculate the
capacitance of a single conductor! If the geometry is simple we can easily
do this. It is not immediately obvious that a single conductor should even
have a capacitance, so it might be a problem if you forget this in a design
problem for an unusual device.

As an example, let's take a sphere. We will assume there is a spherical
conduction shell that is infinitely far away. This configuration gives
exactly the same field lines that the charged sphere gives on it's own, but
the mental picture is helpful. The imaginary shell will give $V=0$ (we set
our zero potential at $r=\infty $). The potential of the little sphere we
know must be just like the potential of a point charge if we are outside of
the sphere%
\begin{equation*}
V=k_{e}\frac{Q}{r}
\end{equation*}%
for $r=R$, the radius of our little sphere. Then 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=k_{e}\frac{Q}{R}-0=k_{e}\frac{Q}{R}
\end{equation*}%
so%
\begin{equation}
C=\frac{Q}{\Delta V}=\frac{Q}{k_{e}\frac{Q}{R}}=\frac{R}{k_{e}}=4\pi
\varepsilon _{o}R
\end{equation}%
This is the capacitance of a single sphere. Note that $C$ only depends on
geometry! not on $Q,$ just as we would expect.

But why would we care? If you have taken ME210 you know about RC circuits.
This says that even if we just connect a ball to, say, the positive terminal
of a batter, that there will be some capacitance. This capacitance will
limit the flow of charge to the ball. So it will take time to charge even a
single conductor. This is always true when a device is initially connected
to a power source. Often we can ignore such \textquotedblleft
transient\textquotedblright\ effects because the charging times are still
small. But in special cases, this may not be possible because the changing
voltage or charge could damage sensitive equipment. So although this is
rarely a problem, it is good to keep in the back of our minds.

\subsection{Capacitance of two parallel plates}

The capacitance of single conductors is profound, but more useful to us in
understanding common electronic components is the parallel plate capacitor.
We found that for parallel plates we also had only geometry factors in the
capacitance. Of course, there are other shapes possible. Let's see if we can
reason out how the capacitance depends on the geometry.

\subsubsection{Plate area}

Since the charge will tend to separate to the surface of a conductor, we
might expect that if the surface area increases, the amount of charge that
the capacitor can hold might increase as well. We see this in our equation
for the parallel plate capacitor.%
\begin{equation*}
C=\frac{A}{d}\epsilon _{o}
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection{Plate separation}

We also see that it matters how far apart the plates are placed. The greater
the distance, the less the capacitance. This makes some sense. If the plates
are farther apart, the Coulomb force is weaker, and less charge can be held
in the capacitor, because the force attracting the charges (the force
between the charges on the opposite plates) is weaker.

\subsection{Capacitance of a cylindrical capacitor}

We should try some harder geometries. A cylindrical capacitor is a good case
to start with

\FRAME{dhF}{1.1682in}{2.0232in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

(you will do a sphere in the homework problems). We want to find the
capacitance of the cylindrical capacitor. Our strategy will be to find the
voltage difference for the capacitor and the amount of charge on the
capacitor, and then divide to find $C.$%
\begin{equation*}
C=\frac{Q}{\Delta V}
\end{equation*}

Let's begin with our equation relating potential change to field.%
\begin{equation}
V_{b}-V_{a}=-\int_{a}^{b}\mathbf{\vec{E}}\cdot d\mathbf{\vec{s}}
\end{equation}%
Let's assume that there is a linear charge density, $\lambda ,$ along the
cylinder with the center positive and the outside negative. Then 
\begin{equation}
\Phi _{E}=\doint \mathbf{\vec{E}}\cdot d\mathbf{\vec{A}}
\end{equation}%
where I will choose a Gaussian surface that is cylindrical around the
central conductor. \FRAME{dhF}{1.7349in}{2.3053in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special%
{language "Scientific Word";type "GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio

"1";cropright "1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename
'N8ESCN6H.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}This is nice, since the field
will be radially out from the conductor (ignoring the end effects) and so no
field will pass through the end caps of the Gaussian surface ($\mathbf{\vec{E%
}}\cdot d\mathbf{\vec{A}=0}$ on the end caps). Moreover, the field strikes
the surface at right angles ($\mathbf{\vec{E}}\cdot d\mathbf{\vec{A}}=EdA$
on the side of the cylinder), and will have the same magnitude all the way
around so 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Phi _{E} &=&E\doint dA \\
&=&EA
\end{eqnarray*}%
Now we know from Gauss' law that%
\begin{equation*}
\Phi _{E}=\frac{Q_{in}}{\varepsilon _{o}}
\end{equation*}%
where 
\begin{equation*}
Q_{in}=\lambda h
\end{equation*}%
and where $h$ is the height of our Gaussian surface, so%
\begin{equation*}
\Phi _{E}=\frac{\lambda h}{\varepsilon _{o}}=E2\pi rh
\end{equation*}%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\lambda }{2\pi r\varepsilon _{o}}=E
\end{equation*}%
Now, knowing our field, and taking a radial path from $a$ to $b$, we can
take 
\begin{eqnarray*}
V_{b}-V_{a} &=&-\int_{a}^{b}\frac{\lambda }{2\pi r\varepsilon _{o}}d\mathbf{r%
} \\
&=&-\frac{\lambda }{2\pi \varepsilon _{o}}\int_{a}^{b}\frac{1}{r}d\mathbf{r}
\\
&=&-\frac{\lambda }{2\pi \varepsilon _{o}}\ln \left( \frac{b}{a}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}%
Using this, we can find the capacitance, We have a negative value for $%
\Delta V,$ but this is just due to our choice of making the center of the
concentric cylinders positive and the outside negative. We chose the zero
point on the positive center. The amount of potential change going from $a$
to $b$ is just $\left\vert \Delta V\right\vert .$ Then in finding the
capacitance using 
\begin{equation*}
Q=C\Delta V
\end{equation*}%
we want just the value of $\Delta V$ so we will plug in the absolute value
of our result.%
\begin{equation*}
\left\vert \Delta V\right\vert =\frac{\lambda }{2\pi \varepsilon _{o}}\ln
\left( \frac{b}{a}\right)
\end{equation*}%
Then, solving for $C$ gives%
\begin{eqnarray*}
C &=&\frac{Q}{\Delta V} \\
&=&\frac{Q}{\frac{\lambda }{2\pi \varepsilon _{o}}\ln \left( \frac{b}{a}%
\right) } \\
&=&\frac{Q}{\frac{Q}{2\pi h\varepsilon _{o}}\ln \left( \frac{b}{a}\right) }
\\
&=&\frac{2\pi h\varepsilon _{o}}{\ln \left( \frac{b}{a}\right) }
\end{eqnarray*}%
Wow! That was fun! But more importantly, this is a coaxial cable geometry,
and we can see that coaxial cable will have some capacitance and that that
capacitance will depend on the geometry of the cable including its length
and width. This capacitance can affect signals sent through the cable. If
you have taken ME210 and have considered RC circuits, you can see why.

We don't want to have to do long calculations to combine capacitors that we
buy from an electronics store. It would be convenient to come up with a way
to combine capacitors using a simple rule.

capacitors in our homework problem drawings, here are the usual symbols for
capacitor and battery. Using these symbols, let's consider two capacitors as
shown below.\FRAME{dhF}{1.8618in}{2.8215in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special%

'N8ESCN6K.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}Remember that a conductor will be
at the same potential over all of its surface. If we connect the capacitors
as shown then all of the left half of this diagram will be at the positive
potential of the battery terminal. Likewise, the right side will all be at
the same potential. It is like we increased the area of the capacitor $C_{1}$
buy adding in the area of capacitor $C_{2}.$ 
\begin{equation*}
C=\frac{A_{1}+A_{2}}{d}\epsilon _{o}=\frac{A_{1}}{d}\epsilon _{o}+\frac{A_{2}%
}{d}\epsilon _{o}
\end{equation*}%
So we may write a combined capacitance for this set up of%
\begin{equation}
C_{eq}=C_{1}+C_{2}
\end{equation}%
We call this set up a \emph{parallel} circuit. This means that each of the
capacitors are hooked directly to the terminals of the battery.

But suppose we hook up the capacitors as in the next drawing\FRAME{ftbpF}{%
2.1414in}{1.7735in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language "Scientific

Now we expect the left hand side of $C_{1}$ to be at the positive potential
of the positive terminal of the battery. We expect the right side of $C_{2}$
to be at the same potential as the negative side of the battery. What
happens in the middle?

We can see that we will have negative charge on the right hand plate of $%
C_{2}$ and positive charge on the left plate of $C_{1}.$ This must cause
there to be a positive charge on the right plate of $C_{1}$ and a negative
charge on the left plate of $C_{2.}$ Moreover, all the charges will have the
same magnitude. That means each of the plates will have a potential
difference%
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V_{1}=\frac{Q}{C_{1}}
\end{equation*}%
and%
\begin{equation*}
\Delta Vj_{2}=\frac{Q}{C_{1}}
\end{equation*}

But the total potential difference is $\Delta V$ of the battery, then 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=\Delta V_{1}+\Delta V_{2}
\end{equation*}%
We can again define an equivalent capacitance.%
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=\frac{Q}{C_{tot}}
\end{equation*}%
then%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta V &=&\Delta V_{1}+\Delta V_{2} \\
\frac{Q}{C_{tot}} &=&\frac{Q}{C_{1}}+\frac{Q}{C_{2}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
The $Q$s are all the same. So%
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{C_{tot}}=\frac{1}{C_{1}}+\frac{1}{C_{2}}
\end{equation}

We call this type of set up a \emph{series circuit}.

Now after all this you might ask yourself how to know the capacitance of the
parts you buy to build things. They are designed by engineers and tested at
the factory, and the capacitance is usually printed on the side of the
device. You can, of course, devise a test circuit based on what we have
learned that could test the capacitance.

\begin{itemize}
\item Dielectrics and capacitors

\item Microscopic nature of electric current

\item Current direction is defined as the direction positive charges would
go, regardless of the actual sign of the charge.

\item In a capacitor, the stored energy is $W=\frac{1}{2}C\Delta V^{2}$

\end{itemize}

\section{Energy stored in a capacitor}

We have convinced ourselves that $\Delta V$ is the change in potential
energy per unit charge, so when a capacitor is charged, and the wires
connecting it to the battery are removed, is there potential energy
\textquotedblleft stored\textquotedblright\ in the capacitor? The answer is
yes, and we can see it by considering what would happen if we connected a
wire (no battery) between the two plates. Charge would rush from one plate
to the other. This is like storing a tank of water on a hill. If we connect
a pipe from the tank at the top of the hill to a tank at the bottom of the
hill, the water will rush through the pipe to the lower tank.

BE CAREFUL, you are enough of a conductor that by touching different ends of
a capacitor you could create a serious current through your body. The
capacitors in computer monitors or TV sets can store enough charge to kill
you!

But how do we know how much energy is there? Clearly it must be related to
the amount of energy it takes to move the charge onto the plates. By
analogy, the energy stored in the water was the minimum amount of energy it
took to pump the water to the upper tank $(mgh).$ It is the minimum, because
our pipes might have some resistance, and then we would have to include more
work to overcome the resistance.

But for a capacitor it is a little bit more tricky. When the capacitor is
not charged, it takes no work (or very little) to move charge from one plate
to the other. But once there is a charge there is an electric field between
the plates (think of my poorly designed water storage system from the
beginning of last lecture). This creates a potential difference. And we must
fight against this potential difference to add more charge. This is sort of
like transferring rocks up a hill. The more rocks that we carry, the higher
the hill gets, and the more work it takes to bring up more rocks.

From our formula%
\begin{equation*}
W=q\left( V_{B}-V_{A}\right)
\end{equation*}%
we can see that if we have just a small amount of charge, $\Delta Q,$ we
will have a small amount of work 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta W=\Delta Q\Delta V
\end{equation*}%
to move it onto the capacitor. Note! here $\Delta Q$ is a small amount of
charge, and $\Delta V$ is $V_{f}-V_{i}$. We have used $\Delta $ in two
different ways in the same equation. If we start with no charge, then go in
small $\Delta Q$ steps, we would see a potential rise as shown in the graph
below.\FRAME{dhF}{2.7984in}{2.5146in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

"1";cropright "1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename
'N8ESCO6M.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}The quantity $\Delta Q\Delta V$
is the area of the shaded (e.g. green) rectangle. So $\Delta W,$ the work it
took to add $\Delta Q$ to the capacitor, is given by the area of a rectangle
under a stair-step on our graph. The shaded rectangle is just one of many
rectangles in the graph. The stair-shape comes from the fact that every time
we deliver a $\Delta Q$ package of charge to the capacitor, it makes the
potential a little higher. It takes more work to bring in the next package
of charge, $\Delta Q.$

From our basic equation 
\begin{equation*}
Q=C\Delta V
\end{equation*}%
we can write, ,for our small bit of charge, $\Delta Q$ 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=\frac{\Delta Q}{C}
\end{equation*}%
As $\Delta Q$ gets small we can go to a continuous charge model 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta W=\Delta Q\Delta V
\end{equation*}%
We can replaced the small unit of charge $\Delta Q$ with a continuous
variable $dq.$to obtain%
\begin{equation*}
dW=dq\left( \Delta V\right)
\end{equation*}%
Recall that%
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=\frac{q}{C}
\end{equation*}%
so we can write $dW$ as 
\begin{eqnarray*}
dW &=&dq\left( \frac{q}{C}\right) \\
dW &=&\frac{1}{C}qdq
\end{eqnarray*}

Of course, we will integrate this%
\begin{eqnarray}
W &=&\int_{0}^{Q}\frac{1}{C}qdq  \notag \\
W &=&\frac{1}{C}\int_{0}^{Q}qdq  \notag \\
&=&\frac{Q^{2}}{2C}
\end{eqnarray}%
or sometimes using 
\begin{equation*}
Q=C\Delta V
\end{equation*}%
this is written as%
\begin{equation}
W=\frac{1}{2}C\Delta V^{2}
\end{equation}

There is a limit to how much energy we can store. That is because even air
can conduct charge if the potential difference is high enough. We call this
air conduction a spark or coronal discharge. At some point charge jumps from
one plate to another through the air in between. If the potential difference
is very high, the Coulomb force between the charges on opposite plates will
force charge to leave one plate and jump to the other even if there is no
air!

\subsection{Field storage}

We usually consider the energy stored in the capacitor to be stored in the
electric field. The field is proportional to the amount of charge and
related to the potential energy, so this seems reasonable. Let's find the
potential energy stored in the field in the capacitor. Recall for an ideal
parallel plate capacitor 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=Ed
\end{equation*}%
and%
\begin{equation*}
C=\epsilon _{o}\frac{A}{d}
\end{equation*}%
We assume that energy provided by the work to move the charges on the
capacitor is all stored as potential energy, so 
\begin{equation}
U_{stored}=\frac{1}{2}C\Delta V^{2}
\end{equation}%
then 
\begin{eqnarray*}
U_{stored} &=&\frac{1}{2}\left( \epsilon _{o}\frac{A}{d}\right) \left(
Ed\right) ^{2} \\
&=&\frac{1}{2}\epsilon _{o}AdE^{2}
\end{eqnarray*}%
We often define an energy density%
\begin{equation*}
u=\frac{U_{stored}}{V}
\end{equation*}%
In this case the volume $V$ is just $Ad$ so 
\begin{equation}
u=\frac{1}{2}\epsilon _{o}E^{2}
\end{equation}%
This is the density of energy in the electric field. It turns out that this
is a general formula (not just true for ideal parallel plate capacitors).

This is a step toward our goal of showing that electric fields are a
physically real thing. They can store energy, so they must be a real thing.

We should ask ourselves a question about our capacitors, does it matter that
there is air in between the plates? For making capacitors, it might be
convenient to coat two sides of a plastic block with metal and solder wires
to the coated sides. Does the plastic have an effect?

Plastic is an insulator, and another name for \textquotedblleft
insulator\textquotedblright\ is \emph{dielectric}. If we perform the
experiment, we will find that when a dielectric is placed in the plates, the
potential difference decreases! \FRAME{dhF}{2.7657in}{2.6256in}{0pt}{}{}{%

but on the ends, there is a net charge. It is like we have oppositely
charged plates next to our capacitor plates. That reduces the net charge
seen by the capacitor, and so the potential difference is less. There is
effectively less separated charge.

But since our capacitor is not connected to a battery or any other
electrical device, the amount of actual charge on the capacitor plates can't
have changed, so if $\Delta V$ changed, but $Q$ did not , then since

Q=C\Delta V

we suspect the material properties part, or the capacitance must have
changed.%
\begin{equation*}
C=\frac{Q_{o}}{\Delta V}=\frac{Q_{o}}{\frac{\Delta V_{o}}{\kappa }}=\frac{%

\section{Induced Charge}

In the last discussion we discovered that if we put a dielectric inside a
capacitor, we end up with polarized charges with the net result that there
will be excess negative charge near the positive plate of the capacitor, and
excess negative charge near the positive plates of the capacitor. In the
middle of the dielectric, the charges are polarized in each atom. But still,
for any volume inside, the net charge is zero. The excess charge near each
plate we will call the \emph{induced charge}.

Since we have an induced positive charge on one side and an induced negative
charge on the other side, we expect there will be an electric field directed
from the positive to negative charge inside the dielectric.\FRAME{dhF}{%

Let's attempt to find the induced charge density on the dielectric. The
total field inside the dielectric is 
\begin{equation}
E=E_{o}-E_{ind}  \label{DielectricInducedField}
\end{equation}%
where $E_{o}$ is the field due to the capacitor plates. From our previous
discussion, we recall that 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=\frac{\Delta V_{o}}{\kappa }
\end{equation*}%
and we recall that the magnitude of the potential difference is given by 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=Ed
\end{equation*}%
Then our new net field can be found%
\begin{equation*}
Ed=\frac{E_{o}d}{\kappa }
\end{equation*}%
or 
\begin{equation*}
E=\frac{E_{o}}{\kappa }
\end{equation*}%
and, recalling for a parallel plate capacitor (near the center) the field is
approximately 
\begin{equation*}
E=\frac{\eta }{\varepsilon _{o}}
\end{equation*}%
then%
\begin{equation*}
E=E_{o}-E_{ind}
\end{equation*}%
gives%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\eta }{\kappa \varepsilon _{o}}=\frac{\eta }{\varepsilon _{o}}-\frac{%
\eta _{ind}}{\varepsilon _{o}}
\end{equation*}%
and we can find the induced surface charge density as 
\begin{equation*}
\eta _{ind}=\eta \left( 1-\frac{1}{\kappa }\right)
\end{equation*}

You might guess that the induced charge is attracted to the charge on the
plates, so a force is required (and work is required) to remove the
dielectric once it is in place. If we draw out the dielectric, we can see
that the weaker field outside the capacitor causes little induced charge,
but the stronger field inside the capacitor causes a large induced charge. A
net inward force will result.\FRAME{dhF}{0.9919in}{1.5212in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure%

For some time now, we have been talking about charge moving. We have had
charge move from a battery to the plates of a conductor. We have had charge
flow from one side to another of a conductor, etc. It is time to become more
exact in describing the flow of charge. We should take some time to figure
out why charge will move.

Let's consider a conductor again.\FRAME{dhF}{3.2301in}{1.9605in}{0pt}{}{}{%
Figure}{\special{language "Scientific Word";type

'N8ESCP6R.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}We remember that in the
conductor, the valance electrons are free to move. In fact, they do move all
the time. The electrons will have some thermal energy just because the
conductor is not at absolute zero temperature. This thermal energy causes
them to move in random directions. (think of air molecules in a room).

Let's take a piece of a wire $\Delta x$ long. The speed of the electrons
along the wire (in the $x$-direction in this case) is called the \emph{drift
speed}, $v_{d},$ because the electrons just drift from place to place with a
fairly small speed. This drift speed could be due mostly to thermal energy,
so it can be very small or even zero (if no electric potential is applied).
Of course, $v_{d},$ must be an average, each charge carrier will be moving
random directions with slightly different speeds, so the $x$-component of
the velocity will be different for each charge carrier, but on average they
will move at a speed $v_{d}.$

\FRAME{dhF}{5.2416in}{1.9527in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

charge carriers of charge $q_{c}$ that are moving through the wire with
velocity $v_{d}.$ Then we can write some length of wire, $\Delta x,$ as 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta x=v_{d}\Delta t
\end{equation*}%
The volume of the shaded piece of wire is 
\begin{equation*}
\mathbb{V}=A\Delta x

if there are 
\begin{equation*}
n=\frac{\#}{\mathbb{V}}
\end{equation*}%
charge carriers per unit volume, a \emph{volume charge carrier number density%
}, then the total charge in our volume is 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta Q=nA\Delta xq_{c}
\end{equation*}%
If we have electrons as our charge carrier, then $q_{c}$ is just $q_{e}.$

We can substitute for $\Delta x$%
\begin{equation*}
\Delta Q=nAv_{d}\Delta tq_{c}
\end{equation*}%
This gives the charge within our small volume. But it would be nice to know
how much charge is going by, because we want moving charge. We can divide by 
$\Delta t$

\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}=nAv_{d}q_{c}  \label{CurrentDefenition}
\end{equation}%
to get a charge flow rate. This is very like our volume or mass flow rate in
fluid flow. We have an amount of charge going by in a time $\Delta t.$

I gave the flow velocity a special name, $v_{d}.$ But I did not give all the
reasons for using an average $x$-component of the velocity. But if we think
about it, we will realize that the electrons don't really flow in a straight
line. They continually bump into atoms\footnote{%
We will refine this picture in the next lecture.}. So the actual path the
electrons take looks more like this.\FRAME{dtbpF}{2.6636in}{1.6821in}{0pt}{}{%

part of this motion. It is that forward component that we call the \emph{%
drift speed} of the electrons. It is much slower than the actual speed the
electrons travel, and it depends on the type of conductor we are using.

We already know the name for the flow rate of charge, it is the electric
current. 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}=I  \label{CurrentAsRate}
\end{equation}

We should take a minute to think about what to expect when we allow charge
to flow. Think of a garden hose. If the hose is full of water, then when we
open the faucet, water immediately comes out. The water that leaves the
faucet is far from the open end of the hose, though. We have to wait for it
to travel the entire length of the hose. But we get water out of the hose
immediately! Why? Well, from Pascal's principle we know that a change in
pressure will be transmitted uniformly throughout the fluid. This is like
your hydraulic breaks. The new water coming in causes a pressure change that
is transmitted through the hose. The water at the open end is pushed out.%

Current is a little bit like this. When we flip a light switch, the
electrons near the near the switch start to flow at $v_{d}.$ But there are
already free electrons in all the wire. These experience a
Pascal's-principle-like-push that makes the light turn on almost instantly.

There is a historical oddity with current flow. It is that the current
direction is the direction positive charges would flow. This may seem
strange, since in good conductors, we have said that electrons are doing the
flowing! The truth is that it is very hard to tell the difference between
positive charge flow and negative charge flow. In fact, only one experiment
that I know of shows that the charge carriers in metals are electrons.

conductor. The experiment is easier to perform using a centrifuge, but it is
easier to visualize with linear motion. If we accelerate a bar of metal as
shown in the preceding figure, the electrons are free to move about in the
metal but the nuclei are all bound together. If the nuclei are accelerated
they must go as a group. But the electrons will tend to stay with their
initial motion (Newton's first law) until the end of the bar reaches them.
At this point they must move because the electrical force of the mass of
nuclei will keep them bound to the whole mass of metal. But the electrons
will pile up at the tail end of the bar--that is--if it is the electrons
that are free. When this experiment is performed, it is indeed the electrons
that pile up at the tail end, and the forward end is left positive. This can
be measured with a voltmeter.

Ben Franklin chose the direction we now use. He had a 50\% chance if getting
the charge carrier right. All this shows just how hard it is to deal with
all these things we can't see or touch. And even more importantly, in
semiconductors and in biological systems, it \emph{is} positive charge that
flows. In many electrochemical reactions \emph{both} positive and negative
charges flow. We will stick with the convention that the current direction
is the direction that positive charges would flow regardless of the actual
charge carrier sign.\FRAME{dtbpFU}{2.3212in}{2.4339in}{0pt}{\Qcb{Flow of

flow called \emph{resistance}.

provides the force that makes current flow

\item Current flow direction is defined to be the direction positive charge
carriers would go

\item The current density is defined as $J=nq_{e}v_{d}$

\item Charge is conserved, so in a circuit, current is conserved.

\item The material property of a conductor that tells us how well the
conductor material will allow current to flow through it is called the
conductivity

\item The inverse of conductivity is the resistivity

\item Resistivity may be temperature dependent

\item Resistance depends on the resistivity of the material and the geometry
of the conductor piece. For a wire it is given by $R=\rho A/L$

\item For many conductors, the change in voltage across the conductor is
proportional to the current and the resistance. This is called Ohm's law

\item The ideal voltage delivered by a battery is called the

Now the charge is free to move inside of the conductor, but it is not
totally unencumbered. The free charges will run into the nuclei of the
atoms. The charges will bounce off. So as they travel through the material
we will expect to see some randomness to their motion. This is compounded by
the fact that the electrons already have random thermal motion. So the path
the charge takes looks somewhat like this

We can recognize that each path segment after a collision must be parabolic
because the acceleration will be constant%
\begin{equation*}
F=ma=qE
\end{equation*}%
so%
\begin{equation*}
a=\frac{qE}{m}
\end{equation*}%
we can describe the electron motion using the two of the kinematic equations 
\begin{eqnarray*}
x_{f} &=&x_{i}+v_{ox}\Delta t+\frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{qE}{m}\right) \Delta
t^{2} \\
v_{fx} &=&v_{ix}+a_{x}\Delta t
\end{eqnarray*}%
Which we reccognize as a parabolic path.

Of course, this is just for one electron, and only for a segment between
collisions. We will have millions of electrons, and therefore, many millions
of bounces. But for each electron, between bounces we expect a parabolic
path. For considering current flow, we don't care about motion perpendicular
to the current direction. So we can look only at the component of the motion
in the flow direction. The net flow in the current direction is toward the
positive plate. Let's see how this works.

If we average the velocities of all the electrons we find 
\begin{eqnarray*}
v_{d} &=&\bar{v}_{x} \\
&=&\bar{v}_{ix}+a_{x}\Delta \bar{t}
\end{eqnarray*}%
the first term $\bar{v}_{ix}=0$ because the initial velocities are random
from the thermal and scattering processes. That is, on average, the
electrons have no preferred direction after a bounce. This leaves%
\begin{equation*}
v_{d}=\left( \frac{qE}{m}\right) \Delta \bar{t}
\end{equation*}%
The average time between collisions, $\Delta \bar{t}$, is sometimes given
the symbol $\tau .$ Let's use this. Recall that current is 
\begin{equation*}
I=nAv_{d}q_{c}
\end{equation*}%
Then, if we rearrange our equaton for $v_{d}$ 
\begin{equation*}
v_{d}=\left( \frac{q\tau }{m}\right) E
\end{equation*}%
we can write our current equation as 
\begin{equation*}
I=nqA\left( \frac{q\tau }{m}\right) E

the conductor. It is this field that causes the charges to flow. We are
right back to an environment (field) and mover charges (electrons)!

This figure is supposed to show our wire connected to the capacitor. The
capacitor is in the background, and the wire loops close to us. The end of
the wire that is connected to the positive side of the capacitor will become
positively charged, and the end connected to the negative side of the
capacitor will become negatively charged. But if we look at the wire an
infinitesimal time after the connection has happened, the wire will not be
uniformly charged. It will take some time for the charges to reach
equilibrium (if you have taken ME210, think of RC circuits). In the mean
time, the charge is stronger near the plates, and diminishes toward the
middle.

We can't find the exact field in the conductor without resorting to a
computational solution, but we can mentally model the situation by viewing
the wire as consisting of rings of charge that vary in surface charge
density. We know the field along the axis due to a ring of charge because we
have done this problem in the past. \FRAME{dhF}{3.6487in}{1.9112in}{0pt}{}{}{%

We know the field is along the axis and that it diminishes with distance
from the ring. Now consider the field due to ring $1.$ As we move to the
right, away from ring $1$ that field will diminish with distance. Also
consider the field due to ring $2.$ As we move to the right toward ring $2$
the field due to ring two will grow. The field due to ring two grows at the
same rate that the field from ring 1 diminishes. The fields $1,$ and $2$ add
up to a constant value along the axis for every point in between the two
rings. Now consider the field on the right side of ring $2$ and the field on
the left side of ring $3$. A little thought shows that the situation is the
same as that for rings $1$ and $2$. We will have a constant net field

on the free charges \emph{inside} the wire. These free charges are not extra
charge. They are the free electrons that are loosely attached to the metal
atoms that make up the wire. So these free charges are distributed
throughout the volume of the wire. These free charges will accelerate,
forming a current inside the wire.

Note that these free charges are not just on the surface, they are inside
the wire, even on the axis of the wire in the center. We no longer have a
static equilibrium, so we no longer have excess charge only on the surface.

All this usually happens very fast, so when we switch on a light, we don't
notice the time it takes for the current to start. But this uneven
distribution of charge is the reason we get a current.

We now realize that when there is an electric field inside a wire, there
will be current flow inside the wire. The flow goes through the volume of
the wire.

The rate of flow is given by%
\begin{equation*}
I=\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}=nq_{e}A\left( \frac{q_{e}\tau }{m_{e}}\right) E
\end{equation*}%
for steady current flow. Here we are writing $q=q_{e}$ for the electron
charge and $m=m_{e}$ for the electron mass, since our charge carrier is an
electron..

The unit for current flow is 
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\unit{C}}{\unit{s}}=\unit{A}
\end{equation*}%

Historically there was no way to tell whether negative charges were flowing
or whether positive charges were flowing. It really did not matter so much

a flow of negative charges the other way.\FRAME{dtbpF}{3.7567in}{3.2742in}{%

Worse, we know that for some systems there are positive charge carriers and
for others negative charge carriers.

\textbf{By convention, we assign the direction of current flow as though the
charge carrier were positive. }

This is great for biologists, where the charge carriers are positive ions.
But for electronics this gives us the uncomfortable situation that the
actual charge carriers, electrons, move in the direction opposite to that of
the current.\FRAME{dhF}{3.4385in}{1.5627in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special%

the part in parentheses contains only bulk properties of the conductor
material, the number of free charges, the charge of the charge carrier, and
the drift speed which depends on the material structure of the conductor.
The final factor is just the cross sectional area of the wire. It gives the
geometry of the wire we have made out of the bulk material (say, copper). It
is convenient to group all the factors that are due to bulk material
properties%
\begin{equation*}
J=nq_{e}v_{d}

\begin{equation*}
I=JA

Note how similar this is to a surface charge density%
\begin{equation*}
Q=\eta A
\end{equation*}%
For a static charged surface, $Q$ is the surface charge density multiplied
by the particular area. For our case we have a total current, $I$ that is
the material properties multiplied by an area. By analogy we could call this
new quantity, $J,$ a kind of density, but now our charges are moving. So
let's call it the \emph{current density.}

Notice that it is the cross sectional area of the wire that shows up in our
current equation. This is another indication that the charge is not flowing
along the surface, but that it is deep within the wire as it flows.

How much of the water is \textquotedblleft used up\textquotedblright\ in
turning the turbine? Another way to say this is to ask if there are $20\unit{%

the lower pipe?

If the turbine leaks, then we might lose some water, but if all is going
well, then you can guess that $20\unit{l}$ of water must also leave the
turbine We can't lose or gain water as the turbine is turned. But we must be
losing something!

the water case. The electric current is a flow of electrons. The flow loses
potential energy, but we don't create or destroy electrons as we convert the
potential energy of the battery to useful work (like making light) just like
we did not create or destroy water in making the turbine turn.

But surely the water slowed down as it traveled through the turbine--didn't
it? Well, no, if the water slows down as it goes through the turbine, then
the pipe below the turbine would run dry. This does not happen. The flow
rate through a pipe does not change under normal conditions, and under
abnormal conditions, we would destroy the pump or the turbine! If we throw
rocks off a hill, they actually gain speed when the water loses potential
energy. Now the flow rate is slower with a turbine in the pipe than it would
be with no turbine in the pipe! But with the turbine in the pipe, the flow
rate is the same throughout the whole pipe system.

Like the water case, the flow rate of charge does not change from point to
point in the wire. The same amount of charge per unit time leaves the wire
as went in.

This explains the reasoning behind one of the great laws of electronics

\begin{Note}
The current is the same at all points in a current-carrying wire.
\end{Note}

Like in the water case, the electrons would flow faster if there were no
light bulb and just a continuous wire. We can have different flow rates in
our wire depending on how much resistance there is to the flow. But the flow
rate will be the same in all parts of the wire system.

This leads to the second of the pair of rules called Kirchhoff's laws:

\begin{equation*}
\sum I_{in}=\sum I_{out}
\end{equation*}%
If the wire branches into two or more pieces, the current will divide. This
is not too surprising. The same is true for water in a pipe%

\chapter{Resistance}

\section{Conductivity and resistivity}

We talked in our last lecture about resistance to electric current. We can
see where that resistance might come from. We have electrons bouncing off of
atoms in the conductor. Some of the collision energy will be converted into
thermal energy of the atoms. Then, different materials will have different
amounts of friction, and even different crystal structures of the same
material will act differently. We need a way to describe how easily a
current can go through a material. Let's look at our equations and see if we
can find an easy expression for the material properties of the conductor
that tell us how well current can flow through it.

%TCIMACRO{%

We defined the current density last lecture 
\begin{equation*}
J=nq_{e}v_{d}
\end{equation*}%
but we know that the drift speed is 
\begin{equation*}
v_{d}=\left( \frac{q_{e}\tau }{m_{e}}\right) E
\end{equation*}%
so we can write the current density as%
\begin{eqnarray*}
J &=&nq_{e}\left( \frac{q_{e}\tau }{m_{e}}\right) E \\
&=&\left( \frac{nq_{e}^{2}\tau }{m_{e}}\right) E
\end{eqnarray*}%
The factor in parentheses depends only on the properties of the conducting
material. For example, if the material is copper, then we would have the $%
n_{copper}=8.5\times 10^{28}\frac{1}{\unit{m}^{3}}$ as the number of valence
electrons per unit meter cubed for copper. The mean time between collisions
is something like $\tau _{copper}=2.5\times 10^{-14}\unit{s}.$ So our
quantity in parentheses is 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\left( \frac{nq_{e}^{2}\tau }{m_{e}}\right) &=&\frac{\left( 8.5\times 10^{28}%
\frac{1}{\unit{m}^{3}}\right) \left( 1.6\times 10^{-19}\unit{C}\right)
^{2}\left( 2.5\times 10^{-14}\unit{s}\right) }{9.11\times 10^{-31}\unit{kg}}
\\
&=&5.\,\allowbreak 971\,5\times 10^{7}\frac{\unit{A}^{2}}{\unit{m}^{3}}\frac{%
\unit{s}^{3}}{\unit{kg}} \\
&=&5.\,\allowbreak 971\,5\times 10^{7}\frac{1}{\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}\unit{m}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
$\allowbreak $

The field is due to something outside of the conducting material (e.g. the
charge on the battery terminals and the extra charge supplied). Again it we
have grouped all the properties of the material together. Lets give a name
to the quantity in parentheses that contains all the material properties.
Since this quantity tells us how easily the charges will go through the
conductive material, we can call this the \emph{conductivity} of the
material.%
\begin{equation*}
\sigma =\frac{nq_{e}^{2}\tau }{m_{e}}
\end{equation*}%
Then 
\begin{equation*}
J=\sigma E
\end{equation*}%
The current density depends on two things, how well the material can allow
the current to flow (bulk material properties related to conduction), $%
\sigma ,$ and and the field that makes the current flow, $E.$

The current, then, depends on these two items, as well as the cross
sectional area of the wire%
\begin{eqnarray*}
I &=&JA \\
&=&\sigma EA
\end{eqnarray*}

Really, the conductivity is more complicated than it appears. The mean time
between collisions, $\tau $, depends on the structure of the conductor.
Different crystalline structures for the same element will give different
values. Think of trying to walk quickly through the Manwering Center crowds
during a class break. This takes some maneuvering. But if all the people
were placed at equally spaced, regular intervals, it might be easier to make
it through quickly. It would also be easier if the crowd stood still.
Likewise, the position of the atoms in the conductor make a big difference
in the conductivity, and thermal motion of those atoms also makes a large
difference. We would expect the conductivity to depend on the temperature of
the material.

It is common to speak of the opposite of the concept of conductance. In
other words, how hard it is to get the electrons to travel through the
conductive material. For example, we might want to build a heating device,
like a toaster or space heater. In this case, we want friction in the wires,
because that friction will produce heat. So specifying a conductive material
by how much friction it has is useful. How much the material impedes the
flow of current is the opposite of how much the material allows the current
flow, so we expect this new quantity to be the inverse of our conductivity%
\begin{equation*}
\rho =\frac{1}{\sigma }=\frac{m_{e}}{nq_{e}^{2}\tau }
\end{equation*}%
Special conductors are often made that use \textquotedblleft
impurities,\textquotedblright\ that is, trace amounts of other atoms, to
increase or decrease the resistivity of conducive materials. The thermal
dependence can be modeled using the equation

\begin{equation*}
\rho =\rho _{o}\left( 1+\alpha \left( T-T_{o}\right) \right)
\end{equation*}%
where $\rho _{o}$ is the resistivity at some reference temperature (usually $%
20\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{2103}}%
%BeginExpansion
{}^{\circ}{\rm C}%
%EndExpansion
}$) and $\alpha $ is a constant that tells us how our particular material
changes resistance with temperature. It is kind of like the specific heat in
thermodynamics $Q=C\Delta T$. This is an approximation. It is a curve fit
that works over normal temperatures. But we would not expect the same
resistive properties, say, if we melt the material. The position of the
atoms would change if the material goes from solid to liquid. So we will
need to be careful in how we use this formula.

Here are some values of the conductivity, resistivity, and temperature
coefficients for a few common conductive materials.%

\subsection{Superconductivity}

The relationship%
\begin{equation*}
\rho =\rho _{o}\left( 1+\alpha \left( T-T_{o}\right) \right)
\end{equation*}%
also breaks down at low temperatures. The low end is very important these
days. For some special materials, the resistivity goes to zero when the
material is cold enough. We call these materials superconductors. A
superconductor can carry huge currents, because there is no loss of energy,
and no heat generated without any friction. Unfortunately most
superconducting materials only operate at temperatures near absolute zero.
But a few \textquotedblleft high temperature\textquotedblright\
superconductors operate at temperatures at high as $125\unit{K}.$ This is
still very cold ($-150\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{2103}}%
%BeginExpansion
{}^{\circ}{\rm C}%
%EndExpansion
}$), but these temperatures are achievable, so some superconducting products
are possible. As you can guess, there is very active research in making
superconductors that operate at even higher temperatures.\FRAME{dtbpFU}{%

\chapter{Ohm's law}

Let's pause to review%
\begin{eqnarray*}
J &=&\sigma E \\
&=&\frac{1}{\rho }E
\end{eqnarray*}

Then the current is given by%
\begin{eqnarray*}
I &=&JA \\
&=&\frac{A}{\rho }E
\end{eqnarray*}%
The field is similar to our capacitor field, nearly uniform in our
conducting wire%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta V &=&Ed \\
&=&E\Delta s
\end{eqnarray*}%
so the electric field is approximately given by 
\begin{equation*}
E=\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta s}
\end{equation*}%
for our wire of length $L$ this is 
\begin{equation*}
E=\frac{\Delta V}{L}
\end{equation*}%
Then we can use this field to write our current%
\begin{equation*}
I=\frac{A}{\rho }\frac{\Delta V}{L}
\end{equation*}%
or rewriting, we have 
\begin{equation*}
I=\left( \frac{A}{L\rho }\right) \Delta V
\end{equation*}%
and rewriting again we have 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=I\left( \rho \frac{L}{A}\right)
\end{equation*}%
The part in parenthesis contains all the friction terms. It says that the
longer the wire, the more friction we will experience. This makes sense. If
you are familiar with fluid flow. The longer the hose, the more resistance.
It also says that the larger the area, the lower the friction. That is also
reasonable, since the electrons will have more places to go unrestricted if
the area is bigger. In water flow, the larger the pipe, the less the water
interacts with the sides of the pipe and therefore the lower the friction.
This situation is analogous.

We should give a name to this quantity that describes the frictional
properties of the wire. We will call it the \emph{resistance} of the wire.%
\begin{equation*}
R=\rho \frac{L}{A}
\end{equation*}%
so that we can write%
\begin{equation*}
I=\frac{\Delta V}{R}
\end{equation*}

The resistance has units of 
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\unit{V}}{\unit{A}}=\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}
\end{equation*}%
where $\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}$ is given the name of \emph{ohm} after the scientist that did pioneering
work on resistance.

The relationship%
\begin{equation*}
I=\frac{\Delta V}{R}
\end{equation*}%
is called \emph{Ohm's law}.

\subsection{Life History of an electric current}

Let's go back and think about our pump model for a battery.

\FRAME{dhF}{5.2382in}{1.3612in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language
"Scientific Word";type "GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio TRUE;display

The pump is a source of potential energy \emph{difference}. This is what a
battery does as well. The battery is a charge pump. It moves the charges
from a low to a high potential. So it is a source of electric potential. The
battery's job is to provide the charge separation that creates the electric
field that drives the free charges, making the current.

A positive charge in the wire on the negative side of the battery is pumped
up to the positive side through a chemical process. We can mentally envision
a small charge pump inside of the battery \FRAME{dhF}{3.1151in}{2.3808in}{0pt%
}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language "Scientific Word";type

3.8311in;cropleft "0";croptop "1";cropright "1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename
'N8ESCT7C.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}

The battery is the source of the potential. A positive charge near the
negative side of the battery would be pumped up to the positive side of the
battery, It would gain potential energy 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta U_{battery}=q\Delta V_{battery}
\end{equation*}%
Then it would \textquotedblleft fall\textquotedblright\ down the wire. It
must lose all of the potential energy it gained. So it will loose 
\begin{equation*}
\left\vert \Delta U_{wire}\right\vert =\left\vert \Delta
U_{battery}\right\vert
\end{equation*}%
but if the battery potential energy change is positive, the wire change must
be negative. We can see that 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V_{wire}=-\Delta V_{battery}
\end{equation*}%
so the potential change in the wire is negative. We sometimes call this a
potential \textquotedblleft drop.\textquotedblright

The field forces our charge to move through this wire much like the
gravitational field forces rocks to fall. The positive charge ends up at the
negative end of the battery again, ready to be pumped up to make another
round.

of course, really this process goes backwards, since our charge carriers are
negative, but we recall that mathematically negative charges going the
opposite way is the same.\ So we will make this picture our mental model of
a current.

This simple model of resistance is great for understanding simple things.
Wires, and resistors do work like this. If we were to take a set of
measurements of $\Delta V$ and $I,$ we expect a straight line%
\begin{eqnarray*}
y &=&mx+b \\
\mathcal{E} &\mathcal{=}&\Delta V=RI+0
\end{eqnarray*}%
where $R$ is the slope. \FRAME{dtbpFX}{1.6457in}{1.4243in}{0pt}{}{}{Plot}{%

But there are times when the model fails terribly. An incandescent light
bulb is an example that we can quickly understand. The resistance at any one
moment fulfils Ohm's law%
\begin{equation*}
I=\frac{\mathcal{E}}{R}
\end{equation*}%
but light bulbs get hot. The resistance will change in time. So our
relationship is now time dependent. Starting with the resistivity, 
\begin{equation*}
\rho =\rho _{o}\left( 1+\alpha \left( T-T_{o}\right) \right)
\end{equation*}%
let's multiply both sides by $A/L.$ 
\begin{equation*}
\frac{A}{L}\rho =\frac{A}{L}\rho _{o}\left( 1+\alpha \left( T-T_{o}\right)
\right)
\end{equation*}%
this gives 
\begin{equation*}
R=R_{o}\left( 1+\alpha \left( T-T_{o}\right) \right)
\end{equation*}%
So if the resistance is temperature dependent, the slope of the line will
change as we go along making measurements. We might get something like this

from Ohm's law. The solid line is what data from a light bulb would actually

that the temperature is a function of time, to obtain 
\begin{equation*}
I=\frac{\mathcal{E}}{R_{o}\left( 1+\alpha \left( T\left( t\right)
-T_{o}\right) \right) }
\end{equation*}%
Since this set of measurements is not strictly following Ohm's law, we will
say that the light bulb is \emph{nonohmic.}

Many common circuit elements are vary nonohmic. A diode, for example, has a $%
\Delta V$ vs. $I$ relationship that looks like this.\FRAME{dtbpFX}{2.4344in}{%

We can now understand how an electric current is formed. We should take some
time to study the basics of how to build electric circuits. We will do that
in the next few lectures.

\section{Electronic symbols}

In our problems we will need to be able to draw diagrams. There are standard
symbols for things like batteries, capacitors, and resisters. It will be
convenient to use these symbols. So here are some symbols to learn.

The figure above is from the FCC Amateur Radio examination. You can see that
we can already identify several of the symbols from our chart. We can also
see that there are others that we have yet to learn!

\chapter{Kirchoff's Rules for Direct Current Circuits}

\section{EMF}

Once again, we need to introduce a quantity that has an historic name. Let's
save the name for last (since it is kind of dumb).

We have thought of a battery as a \textquotedblleft charge
pump,\textquotedblright\ something that takes charge from a low potential to
a high potential. This is like a water pump taking water from a low tank to
a high tank. Once the water is at the higher tank, it can be used to do work
by allowing it to flow back down to the lower tank (and move paddle wheels
or something along the way). As usual, we want to think of the work per unit
charge done by this "charge pump." We will give a \textquotedblleft charge
pump\textquotedblright\ a new name. We will call it the \emph{source of emf}
and write it with the symbol $\mathcal{E}.$ What does emf stand for? I am
not going to tell you, because the original meaning is historical and was
very wrong. But we have a long tradition of calling a \textquotedblleft
charge pump\textquotedblright\ a source of emf, so we have to keep using
this term. Think of Kentucky Fried Chicken changing to KFC so we don't have
to say \textquotedblleft fried chicken\textquotedblright\ and think of the
calories. There is only a small difference between an emf and a voltage
difference. A difference that we will discuss in a lecture or two. So for
now, really we are just naming the $\Delta V$ of a battery $\mathcal{E}$ and
calling it by a nickname emf.

\section{Conservation of Charge (Reprise) and Conservation of Energy}

A few lectures ago, we studied conservation of charge for a circuit.

\begin{equation*}
\sum I_{in}=\sum I_{out}
\end{equation*}%
If the wire branches into two or more pieces, the current will divide. This
is not too surprising. The same is true for water in a pipe%

This is really a statement of the idea of \emph{conservation of charge}. As
the charge flows through the circuit, no electrons get lost, and no
electrons are created. An early researcher's name is applied to this
relationship. It is called \emph{Kirchhoff's junction rule.}

We can combine this with another conservation law, \emph{conservation of
energy.}

\section{Combinations in series and parallel}

We discovered the rules for adding capacitors in parallel and series, now
let's do the same for resistors

\subsection{Series Resistances}

\begin{equation*}
\begin{tabular}{||l||}
\hline\hline
Series connection of light bulb demo \\ \hline\hline
\end{tabular}%
\end{equation*}

If we add light bulbs in series, the lights are individually dimmer than if
we just had one bulb. We can conclude that adding in lights must reduce the
current. The lights are resisters\footnote{%
But not Ohmic resistors!} and this is true for any resistor \FRAME{dtbpF}{%
1.6483in}{1.7945in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language "Scientific

We say the current through the circuit must be the same throughout the whole
circuit. We don't build up charge or remove charge anywhere (no capacitors
yet). But the potential is not the same at each point in the circuit. Think
of a series of water tanks and a pump as shown in the next figure.

\FRAME{dtbpF}{4.6899in}{2.6532in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language
"Scientific Word";type "GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio TRUE;display

"1";cropright "1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename
'N8ESCV7L.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}The pump increases the potential
energy of the water. The water's potential energy can then be used as it is
lowered, first to a tank half way down, then all the way to the lower tank.
It is easy to see that%
\begin{equation}
\Delta U=\Delta U_{1}+\Delta U_{2}
\end{equation}%
that is, the total energy given up to get to the lower tank is just the
energy the pump provided to the water to get it to the upper tank. If we
choose the zero point for the potential energy to be the lower tank, then
the pump gives a positive $\Delta U$ and each of the waterfalls give
negative $\Delta U$ values. So we start with zero potential energy, gain
potential energy, then lose it in series of steps returning to zero
potential energy when the water is back in the lower tank. We could write
this as 
\begin{equation*}
0=\sum_{i}\Delta U_{i}
\end{equation*}%
the sum of the potential energy changes must be zero as we go around the
water loop. This is conservation of energy. No energy has been lost. We
start and end with the same value.

In a circuit, we use potential energy per unit charge, but the situation is
very much the same. \FRAME{dhF}{2.1266in}{1.6907in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special%

pumps\textquotedblright\ the charge to a higher potential. The current
\textquotedblleft drops\textquotedblright\ in potential as it goes though
resister $R_{1}$ (the top resister). It also \textquotedblleft
drops\textquotedblright\ in potential as it goes through resister $R_{2}$
(the bottom one). Since the charge along the bottom wire must be at the same
potential as the negative pole of the battery, we can say that the
\textquotedblleft drop\textquotedblright\ in potential for each battery mush
have used all the potential that was originally supplied by the battery.%
\begin{equation}
\Delta V=\Delta V_{1}+\Delta V_{2}  \label{potential_aross_two_resisters}
\end{equation}%
If we choose the zero point for the electric potential to be the negative
side of the battery, then the battery gives a positive $\Delta UV$ and each
of the resisters give negative $\Delta V$ values. So we start with zero
potential at the negative side of the battery, gain potential energy, then
lose it in series of steps returning to zero potential when the charge is
back at the negative side of the battery. We could write this as 
\begin{equation*}
0=\sum_{i}\Delta V_{i}
\end{equation*}%
the sum of the potential changes must be zero as we go around the current
loop. This is also conservation of energy. Electrical potential is potential
energy per unit charge, and all our charges are the same, electron charge. So%
\begin{equation*}
0=\sum_{i}\Delta V_{i}=\frac{1}{q}\sum_{i}\Delta U_{i}
\end{equation*}%
No energy has been lost. We start and end with the same value.

This is another of the rules cataloged by Kirchhoff and it is called \emph{%
Kirchhoff's loop rule.}

Now we know that 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=IR
\end{equation*}%
We can use this to re-write equation \ref{potential_aross_two_resisters}.%
\begin{eqnarray*}
0 &=&\sum_{i}\Delta V_{i}=\Delta V_{battery}+\Delta V_{1}+\Delta V_{2} \\
&=&\Delta V_{battery}-IR_{1}-IR_{2}
\end{eqnarray*}%
where we see that the voltage drops are negative as we expected. We could
rewrite this as%
\begin{equation}
\Delta V=IR_{1}+IR_{2}
\end{equation}%
Since charge is conserved, and we don't allow the charge to pool up or leak
out, we can say that the charge in the entire series circuit must be the
same. So%
\begin{equation}
\Delta V=I\left( R_{1}+R_{2}\right)
\end{equation}%

\subsection{Kirchhoff's Rules}

We have collected some good rules for adding resisters and capacitors.
Kirchhoff is credited with succinctly stating these rules

\begin{Note}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The sum of the currents entering any junction must equal the sum of
the currents leaving that junction. (conservation if charge--junction rule)

\item The sum of the potential differences across all the elements around
any closed circuit loop must be zero (conservation of energy--loop rule)
\end{enumerate}
\end{Note}

When we actually apply these rules, we

\begin{enumerate}
\item assign symbols and directions to the currents in all branches of the
circuit. Don't worry about the getting the sign (direction) of the currents
right. If you guess wrong, the answer will just be negative, so you will
know it really goes the other way

\item When applying the conservation of energy or loop rule, choose a
direction for traversing the loop and be consistent. Record potential drops
or rises, so you can make sure the they sum to zero. Use the following rules.

\begin{enumerate}
\item If a resister is traversed in the direction of the current you chose,
the change in the potential across the resister is $-IR.$ This is a voltage
drop.

\item If a resister is traversed in the direction opposite the current you
chose, the change in the potential across the resister is $+IR.$ This is
like going up-hill so the change in potential is positive.

\item You must include the source of emf (battery). If it is traversed in
the direction of the emf (from $-$ to $+$) the charge in potential is $+%
\mathcal{E}.$

\item If the source of emf is traversed in the opposite direction of the emf
(from $+$ to $-$) the change in potential is $-\mathcal{E}.$ This is like
going the wrong way through the water pump. You are going down-hill so you
are loosing potential energy.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

A capacitor acts as a break in the wire; no current flows through the wire
(for now, anyway).

Suppose we do an example

\section{Series Resistances}

Let's return to our basic circuit with two resisters. When we had more than
one capacitor in a circuit, we found the equivalent \FRAME{dtbpF}{4.7919in}{%

resisters. We want a single, equivalent resistance $R_{eq}$ such that 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V_{bat}+\Delta V_{eq}=0
\end{equation*}%
where%
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V_{eq}=IR_{eq}
\end{equation*}%
Recall that%
\begin{equation}
\Delta V_{bat}=\Delta V_{1}+\Delta V_{2}
\end{equation}

And 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V_{bat}=IR
\end{equation*}%
So%
\begin{equation}
\Delta V_{bat}=IR_{1}+IR_{2}
\end{equation}%
Since charge is conserved, and we don't allow the charge to pool up or leak
out, we can say that the charge in the entire series circuit must be the
same. So%
\begin{equation}
IR_{eq}=I\left( R_{1}+R_{2}\right)
\end{equation}
The current cancels, so we have found what we were looking for. The
equivalent resistance is given by$.$%
\begin{equation}
R_{eq}=R_{1}+R_{2}
\end{equation}

\section{Examples}

Let's try a problem with series resisters. Here is a circuit with two
resisters and two batteries. Let's find the current and the voltage drop
across each resister. We need to know that the resistances are $R_{1}=600%
\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}$ and $R_{2}=1000\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}$. We also need to know the batteries' emfs they are $\mathcal{E}_{1}=$ $3%
\unit{V}$ and $\mathcal{E}_{2}=9\unit{V}.$ \FRAME{dtbpF}{2.4033in}{1.8144in}{%

\begin{equation*}
\Delta V_{b1}+\Delta V_{b2}+\Delta V_{R1}+\Delta V_{R2}=0
\end{equation*}%
Let's envision going counter clockwise around the loop (we get to choose
which way we go) and let's envision starting at the negative side of $b2.$
We also can use Ohm's law%
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=IR
\end{equation*}%
to write our loop equation as 
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{E}_{1}+\mathcal{E}_{2}-IR_{1}-IR_{2}=0
\end{equation*}%
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{E}_{1}+\mathcal{E}_{2}=IR_{1}+IR_{2}
\end{equation*}%
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{E}_{1}+\mathcal{E}_{2}=I\left( R_{1}+R_{2}\right)
\end{equation*}%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\mathcal{E}_{1}+\mathcal{E}_{2}}{\left( R_{1}+R_{2}\right) }=I
\end{equation*}%
and we have found the current!%
\begin{eqnarray*}
I &=&\frac{3\unit{V}+9\unit{V}}{\left( 600\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}+1000\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}\right) } \\
&=&0.007\,5\unit{A}
\end{eqnarray*}

The voltage drop across the resisters is then 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta V_{R1} &=&IR_{1} \\
\Delta V_{R2} &=&IR_{2}
\end{eqnarray*}%
or%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta V_{R1} &=&\left( 0.007\,5\unit{A}\right) \left( 600\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion

\Delta V_{R2} &=&\left( 0.007\,5\unit{A}\right) \left( 1000\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}\right) =7.5\unit{V}
\end{eqnarray*}%
we should check our loop rule with our results%
\begin{equation*}
3\unit{V}+9\unit{V}+4.\,\allowbreak 5\unit{V}+7.5\unit{V}=0
\end{equation*}%
so this solution works!

Let's try another problem.

\FRAME{dtbpF}{3.5215in}{2.7959in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language
"Scientific Word";type "GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio TRUE;display

'N8ESCX7O.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}Let's use the same resisters and
batteries, but reconfigure them as shown. And let's go clockwise around the
loop this time. Let's assume that $I$ is also clockwise. This is a guess,
but if we are wrong, we will just get a negative current, so we will know it
goes the other way.

Then, starting on the negative size of $\Delta V_{2}$ we have

\begin{equation*}
\Delta V_{2}+\Delta V_{R1}+\Delta V_{1}+\Delta V_{R2}=0
\end{equation*}%
As we go around the loop we go up-hill through $\Delta V_{2}$ so $\Delta
V_{2}=+\mathcal{E}_{2}$%
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{E}_{2}+\Delta V_{R1}+\Delta V_{1}+\Delta V_{R2}=0
\end{equation*}%
and we go down hill through $R_{1}$ so $\Delta V_{R1}=-IR_{1}$ 
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{E}_{2}-IR_{1}+\Delta V_{1}+\Delta V_{R2}=0
\end{equation*}%
but notice that as we arrive at $\Delta V_{1}$ we are going the wrong way
through the pump. We are going down hill. So $\Delta V_{1}=-\mathcal{E}_{1}$%
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{E}_{2}-IR_{1}+-\mathcal{E}_{1}+\Delta V_{R2}=0
\end{equation*}%
finally, we are going in the current direction through $R_{2}$ so we are
going down hill. $\Delta V_{R_{2}}=-IR_{2}$%
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{E}_{2}-IR_{1}+-\mathcal{E}_{1}+-IR_{2}=0
\end{equation*}

Now we can solve for the current like we did before 
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{E}_{2}+-\mathcal{E}_{1}=IR_{1}+IR_{2}
\end{equation*}%
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{E}_{2}+-\mathcal{E}_{1}=I\left( R_{1}+R_{2}\right)
\end{equation*}%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\mathcal{E}_{2}+-\mathcal{E}_{1}}{\left( R_{1}+R_{2}\right) }=I
\end{equation*}%
then 
\begin{equation*}
I=\frac{9\unit{V}-3\unit{V}}{\left( 600\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}+1000\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}\right) }=0.003\,75\unit{A}
\end{equation*}%
we got lucky and picked the right direction for the current! From 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta V_{R1} &=&IR_{1} \\
\Delta V_{R2} &=&IR_{2}
\end{eqnarray*}%
we can find the potential drop across each resister%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta V_{R1} &=&\left( 0.003\,75\unit{A}\right) \left( 600\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}\right) =2.\,\allowbreak 25\unit{V} \\
\Delta V_{R2} &=&\left( 0.003\,75\unit{A}\right) \left( 1000\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}\right) =3.\,\allowbreak 75\unit{V}
\end{eqnarray*}%
and once again we check to find%
\begin{equation*}
9\unit{V}-2.\,\allowbreak 25\unit{V}+-3\unit{V}+-3.\,\allowbreak 75\unit{V}=0
\end{equation*}%
You might be concerned, It looks like we put one battery in the circuit
backwards. Why would we ever do that? But remember when we studied lead acid
batteries? To recharge a the battery we had to run the process backward.
This means we put the battery in the circuit backwards. There are other
reasons we might do this, but one is to make a battery charger.

You might guess that things could get more complicated. An that is certainly
true. In the next lecture we will combine resisters and batteries in harder
ways, and we will add in capacitors!

\section{Power in resisters}

We learned that the resistance in a resister depends on the temperature of
the resister, and even have an approximate relationship that shows how this
works%
\begin{equation*}
R=R_{o}(1+\alpha \left( T-T_{o})\right)
\end{equation*}%
so we know that temperature and resistance are related. But most of us have
used a toaster, or an electric stove, or an electric space heater, etc. How
does an electric circuit produce heat? or even light from a light bulb?

To answer this let's think of the energy expended as an electron travels a
circuit. The potential energy expended is 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta U=q\Delta V
\end{equation*}%
where the $\Delta V$ comes from the battery, so we could write this as 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta U=q\mathcal{E}
\end{equation*}%
This is the energy lost as the electron travels from one side of the battery
to the other. We could describe how fast the energy is lost by dividing by
the time it takes the electron to make the trip%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta T}=\frac{q}{\Delta t}\mathcal{E}
\end{equation*}%
but of course we want to do this for more than one electron. Let's take a
packet of charge, $\Delta Q,$ then 
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta T}=\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}\mathcal{E}
\end{equation*}%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta T}=\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}\mathcal{E}
\end{equation*}%
and if we make the packet of charge small we have 
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dU}{dT}=\frac{dQ}{dt}\mathcal{E}
\end{equation*}%
and we recognize $dU/dt$ as the power and $dQ/dt$ as current, then 
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{P}=I\mathcal{E}
\end{equation*}

This is the power supplied by the battery in moving the group of electrons
through the circuit. But from Kirchhoff's loop rule, the charge packet must
lose all the energy that the battery provides, so 
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{P}_{battery}=\mathcal{P}_{R}=I\Delta V_{R}
\end{equation*}%
is the energy that leaves the circuit as the packet of charge moves.

This equation is general 
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{P}_{R}=I\Delta V_{R}
\end{equation*}
so it works for any resistance, but if the resister is ohmic, then we can
use Ohm's law%
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V_{R}=IR
\end{equation*}%
to find 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathcal{P}_{R} &=&I\left( IR\right) \\
&=&I^{2}R
\end{eqnarray*}%
but this is only true for ohmic resisters.

But where does this energy go? This is the energy that makes the heat in the
space heater, or the light in the light bulb.

\subsection{Parallel Resistances}

We found the equivalent resistance for resisters in series last lecture. You
probably thought at the time that we would need an equivalent resistance for
resisters in parallel. And you were right. For a parallel circuit, all the
top parts of the circuit (see diagram below) are connected to the positive
side of the battery. All the bottom parts are connected to the negative side
of the battery. Since the connections are with conductors, we can see that
the potential \textquotedblleft drop\textquotedblright\ across each resister
must be the same as the potential gain from the battery \textquotedblleft
pump.\textquotedblright\ Both branches of the circuit let the current
\textquotedblleft drop\textquotedblright\ the same amount.

\FRAME{dtbpF}{3.6305in}{1.8204in}{0in}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

'OH2BDS00.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}But we can see from charge
conservation that the currents in the resisters will not be the same. At
point $A,$ we can see that 
\begin{equation}
I=I_{1}+I_{2}
\end{equation}%
again we can use 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=IR
\end{equation*}%
but we want to write it as 
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\Delta V}{R}=I
\end{equation*}%
then from the junction rule we see that 
\begin{equation*}
I_{b}=I_{1}+I_{2}
\end{equation*}%
or%
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta V}{R_{eq}}=\frac{\Delta V}{R_{1}}+\frac{\Delta V}{R_{2}}
\end{equation}%
so%
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{R_{eq}}=\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\frac{1}{R_{2}}
\end{equation}%
We can solve this for the equivalent resistance of the circuit, first get
common denominators%
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{R_{eq}}=\frac{1}{R_{1}}\frac{R_{2}}{R_{2}}+\frac{1}{R_{2}}\frac{%
R_{1}}{R_{1}}
\end{equation}%
then add the RHS%
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{R_{eq}}=\frac{R_{2}+R_{1}}{R_{1}R_{2}}
\end{equation}%
Now we can invert both sides%
\begin{equation}
\frac{R_{1}R_{2}}{R_{2}+R_{1}}=\frac{R_{eq}}{1}
\end{equation}%
or%
\begin{equation}
R_{eq}=\frac{R_{1}R_{2}}{R_{2}+R_{1}}
\end{equation}%
This is always \emph{smaller} than $R_{1}$ or $R_{2}.$ For example, if $%
R_{1}=R_{2}$ then 
\begin{equation}
R_{eq}=\frac{RR}{R+R}=\frac{RR}{2R}=\frac{R}{2}
\end{equation}%
or the equivalent resistance of the circuit is half the resistance of the
individual resisters.

\subsection{Emf}

We have ignored something in our pump model of a battery. In real water
flow, there would be resistance to the flow even inside the pump. This
resistance would be small, but not zero. So the actual potential energy gain
would be 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta U=\Delta U_{\text{ideal}}-U_{\text{loss due to friction}}
\end{equation*}%
The same is true for an actual battery. There is some resistance in the
battery, itself.%
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=\Delta V_{\text{ideal}}-\Delta V_{\text{loss due to resistance}}
\end{equation*}%
Now that we have Ohm's law, we can saw what $\Delta V_{\text{loss due to
resistance}}$ would be in terms of the internal resistance of the battery
and the current that flows. Referring to the last figure, there is only one
way for the current to go. So for this circuit, the current must be the same
throughout the entire circuit., even in the battery! If we call the small
resistance in the battery $r,$ then 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V_{\text{loss due to resistance}}=Ir
\end{equation*}%
and 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=\Delta V_{\text{ideal}}-Ir
\end{equation*}%
It is traditional to give the ideal voltage a name and a symbol. We have
encountered them before. This is the emf. At one time, the letters `e', `m',
and `f' stood for something. But not any more. It is just a name. It is
pronounced \textquotedblleft \={e}-em-ef,\textquotedblright\ and the symbol
is a script capital $\mathcal{E}$.

When we first encountered emf we said it was essentially just the potential
difference, but now we see that there is a difference. That difference is
because of the internal resistance of the battery. 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=\mathcal{E}-Ir
\end{equation*}%
Sometimes you will hear $\mathcal{E}$ referred to as the voltage you would
get if the battery is not connected (the \textquotedblleft open
circuit\textquotedblright\ voltage). This is the voltage marked on the
battery. Notice that the actual voltage provided at the battery terminals
depends on how much current is being drawn from the battery. So if you are
draining your battery quickly (say, using your electric starter motor to
start your car engine) the voltage supplied by your battery might drop (your
lights might dim while the starer motor runs). You are not getting $12\unit{V%
}$ because the current $I$ is large while the starter motor runs. We will
change to this new symbol for ideal voltage. But we should keep in mind that
actual voltages delivered may be significantly less than this ideal emf
unless we plan our designs carefully.

\section{Circuits made from Resisters}

Let's try to use all we know about resisters and batteries to do a harder
problem.

Determine the current in each branch of the circuit shown in the following
figure.\FRAME{dtbpF}{3.712in}{2.1988in}{0in}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

currents $I_{1},$ $I_{2},$ and $I_{3}$ and I have given them directions. We
have junctions now, so we can use the junction rule. I can write an equation
using the top junction%
\begin{equation}
0=I_{3}-I_{2}-I_{1}
\end{equation}%
Note that we have used all the currents we have, so we can stop with this
one junction. The other junction at the bottom just gives%
\begin{equation*}
0=-I_{3}+I_{2}+I_{1}
\end{equation*}%
which gives the same equation. This is typical, usually we don't need all
the junctions, but we do need to use enough junctions that every current
shows up in an equation.

Now let's use the loop rule. Starting with the right most loop and going
counter clock wise. \FRAME{dtbpF}{4.1644in}{2.4649in}{0in}{}{}{Figure}{%

Now lets take the left most loop, starting again with a battery\FRAME{dtbpF}{%

\begin{equation*}
\begin{tabular}{||l||}
\hline\hline
Concept Question 18.1 - 18.3 \\ \hline\hline
\end{tabular}%
\end{equation*}

Let's use our new $emf$ notation to write the charge on a capacitor%
\begin{equation*}
Q=C\Delta V
\end{equation*}%
or now, with an ideal battery,%
\begin{equation*}
Q=C\mathcal{E}
\end{equation*}%
when the capacitor is fully charged (so $I=0$ and $r$ does not matter).

Now consider what happens in the circuit shown below\FRAME{dtbpF}{3.205in}{%
1.8645in}{0in}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language "Scientific Word";type
"GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio TRUE;display "USEDEF";valid_file "T";width

With the switch open, the capacitor is uncharged . So $Q=0$ before the
switch is closed. It takes some time for current to start to flow after.

\begin{equation*}
\begin{tabular}{||l||}
\hline\hline
$10\unit{F}$ capacitor and bulb demo \\ \hline\hline
\end{tabular}%
\end{equation*}%
We can see that if we let $t=0$ be the time the switch is closed, at $t=0$
we still have $Q=0.$ We will have a current of 
\begin{equation*}
I_{o}=\frac{\mathcal{E}}{R}
\end{equation*}%
at this initial time.

We expect that at some later time, $t_{long}$ we will have 
\begin{equation*}
Q=C\mathcal{E}
\end{equation*}%
When this happens, $\Delta V$ of the capacitor will be equal to $\mathcal{E}%
. $ Since the potential is equal to the potential of the battery, the
current must stop by $t_{long}$. It would be good to be able to calculate
what happens between $t=0$ and $t=t_{long}.$

\subsection{RC charge as function of time}

We can do this using Kirchhoff's loop rule.%
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V_{battery}-\Delta V_{C}-\Delta V_{R}=0
\end{equation*}%
or%
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{E}-\frac{q}{C}-IR=0
\end{equation*}%
and we know that the current $I=dq/dt$ so%
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{E}-\frac{q}{C}-\frac{dq}{dt}R=0
\end{equation*}%
rearranging gives%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\mathcal{E}}{R}-\frac{q}{RC}=\frac{dq}{dt}
\end{equation*}%
which is a wonderful differential equation--one we can solve. We separate
the variables $dq$ and $dt$%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{C\mathcal{E}-q}{RC}=\frac{dq}{dt}
\end{equation*}%
then%
\begin{equation*}
dt=\frac{dq}{\frac{C\mathcal{E}-q}{RC}}
\end{equation*}%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dt}{RC}=\frac{dq}{C\mathcal{E}-q}
\end{equation*}%
and we integrate both sides%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{RC}\int_{0}^{t}dt^{\prime }=\int_{o}^{q}\frac{1}{C\mathcal{E}%
-q^{\prime }}dq^{\prime }
\end{equation*}%
or%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{t}{RC}=\int_{o}^{q}\frac{1}{C\mathcal{E}-q^{\prime }}dq^{\prime }
\end{equation*}%
now we let $u=C\mathcal{E}-q$ so $du=-dq$ and our limits of $q^{\prime }=0$
gives $u=C\mathcal{E}$ and the limit of $q^{\prime }=q$ gives $u=C\mathcal{E}%
-q$ 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{t}{RC} &=&-\int_{C\mathcal{E}}^{C\mathcal{E}-q}\frac{1}{u}du \\
&=&\left. -\ln u\mathstrut \right\vert _{C\mathcal{E}}^{C\mathcal{E}-q} \\
&=&-\left( \ln \left( C\mathcal{E}-q\right) -\ln \left( C\mathcal{E}\right)
\right) \\
&=&-\ln \left( \frac{C\mathcal{E}-q}{C\mathcal{E}}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}%
then%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{t}{RC}=-\ln \left( \frac{C\mathcal{E}-q}{C\mathcal{E}}\right)
\end{equation*}%
Exponentiating both sides gives%
\begin{eqnarray*}
e^{-\frac{t}{RC}} &=&\left( \frac{C\mathcal{E}-q}{C\mathcal{E}}\right) \\
e^{-\frac{t}{RC}} &=&1-\frac{q}{C\mathcal{E}} \\
e^{-\frac{t}{RC}} &=&1-\frac{q}{C\mathcal{E}} \\
e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}-1 &=&-\frac{q}{C\mathcal{E}} \\
C\mathcal{E}\left( 1-e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}\right) &=&q
\end{eqnarray*}%
and now we recognize that 
\begin{equation*}
Q=C\Delta V=C\mathcal{E}
\end{equation*}%
as the total charge that the capacitor can hold, then%
\begin{equation}
q\left( t\right) =Q\left( 1-e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}\right)
\end{equation}

\subsection{RC example}

The small $q$ is the charge is has at the current time. This will get bigger
until at $t_{long}$ it will reach $Q.$ The letter $e$ here is the base of
the natural logarithm. Suppose we had the following values%
\begin{equation}
\begin{tabular}{l}
$R=2\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}$ \\ 
$C=10\unit{F}$ \\ 
$\mathcal{E}=1.5\unit{V}$%
\end{tabular}%
\end{equation}%
then our charge as a function of time would be%
\begin{equation}
q(t)=\left( 10\unit{F}\right) \left( 1.5\unit{V}\right) \left( 1-e^{-\frac{t%
}{\left( 2\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}\right) \left( 10\unit{F}\right) }}\right)
\end{equation}%
We can plot this\FRAME{dtbpFX}{2.3682in}{1.5797in}{0pt}{}{}{Plot}{\special%

'N8ESDN0U.xvz';valid_file "T";tempfilename
'N8ESCZ7R.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}notice, that by about $t=70\unit{s%
}$ we essentially have $q=Q.$ But up to that point, the charge changes in a
very non-linear way. The part of the equation that looks like%
\begin{equation*}
\left( 1-e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}\right)
\end{equation*}%
is interesting, what is $e^{0}$?%
\begin{equation*}
e^{0}=1
\end{equation*}%
so at $t=0$ we do have $q=0$ because 
\begin{equation*}
\left( 1-e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}\right) =\left( 1-1\right)
\end{equation*}%
For any positive time, $e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}$ will be less than $1.$ For large
times $\frac{t}{RC}$ gets to be a big number. So $e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}$ gets
very small, So $\left( 1-e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}\right) $ gets very close to $1.$
That means that 
\begin{equation*}
q=Q\left( 1-e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}\right) \rightarrow Q\left( 1\right) =Q
\end{equation*}%
just as we saw in the graph and as we know it must.

We sometimes give a name to $R\times C$

\begin{equation}
\tau =RC
\end{equation}%
this is called the \emph{time constant} because it tells us something about
how long it takes for $q$ to go from $0$ to get to $Q.$ The
\textquotedblleft t-looking-thing\textquotedblright\ is a Greek letter
\textquotedblleft t\textquotedblright\ It is pronounced \textquotedblleft
tau.\textquotedblright\ Note that we also use $\tau $ for torque, but this
is really not torque. It is an amount of time.

\subsection{RC Current}

We can also find the current. We know that 
\begin{equation*}
I=\frac{dq}{dt}=\frac{d}{dt}Q\left( 1-e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}\right) =-Q\frac{d}{dt%
}e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}=\frac{Q}{RC}e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}
\end{equation*}%
but from $Q=C\mathcal{E}$ we have%
\begin{eqnarray*}
I\left( t\right) &=&\frac{\mathcal{E}}{R}e^{-\frac{t}{RC}} \\
&=&I_{o}e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
where $I_{o}$ is the maximum current $I_{\max }=\mathcal{E}/R$. For our case
this looks like%
\begin{equation*}
I\left( t\right) =0.75\unit{A}e^{-\frac{t}{20\unit{s}}}
\end{equation*}

\subsection{RC Discharging}

To understand better what the time constant means, lets now remove the
battery from the circuit, but let the circuit stay connected (say, replace
the battery with a piece of wire). Now we find that the charge seems to fade
away! 
\begin{equation*}
\begin{tabular}{||l||}
\hline\hline
$10\unit{F}$ capacitor and bulb demo \\ \hline\hline
\end{tabular}%
\end{equation*}

We can calculate what the charge would be as a function of time. We probably
won't have time to do this in class, but really it is just the same the
answer is%
\begin{equation}
q=Qe^{-\frac{t}{RC}}=Qe^{-\frac{t}{\tau }}
\end{equation}%
We find by again taking Kirchhoffs rule%
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V_{bat}-\Delta V_{C}-\Delta V_{R}=0
\end{equation*}%
or%
\begin{equation*}
0-\frac{q}{C}-IR=0
\end{equation*}%
Again writing out the current gives%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{q}{RC} &=&-\frac{dq}{dt} \\
\frac{dt}{RC} &=&-\frac{dq}{q}
\end{eqnarray*}%
and integrating gives%
\begin{equation*}
-\frac{1}{RC}\int_{0}^{t}dt^{\prime }=\int_{Q}^{q}\frac{dq^{\prime }}{%
q^{\prime }}
\end{equation*}%
so%
\begin{equation*}
-\frac{t}{RC}=\ln \left( \frac{q}{Q}\right)
\end{equation*}%
and exponentiating both sides gives%
\begin{equation}
q=Qe^{-\frac{t}{RC}}=Qe^{-\frac{t}{\tau }}
\end{equation}%
Now we can see that if $t=\tau ,$ then%
\begin{equation*}
q=Qe^{-\frac{t}{RC}}=Qe^{-\frac{1}{1}}=Qe^{-1}
\end{equation*}%
since $e=2.\,\allowbreak 718\,3,$ 
\begin{equation*}
e^{-1}=\frac{1}{e}=\allowbreak 0.367\,88
\end{equation*}%
so we have 
\begin{equation*}
q=\allowbreak 0.367\,88Q
\end{equation*}%
That is, after a time $\tau ,$ we are at about $37\%$ of the original
charge, or we have \emph{lost} about $63\%$ of the original charge.
Likewise, if we decide to recharge our capacitor, $\tau $ will tell us how
long it takes to gain $63\%$ of the full charge.

We can say a capacitor \emph{discharges} when it looses its charge. Let's
plot the discharge.\FRAME{dtbpFX}{2.3682in}{1.5797in}{0pt}{}{}{Plot}{\special%

\unit{s},$ we have discharged. At $\tau =10\unit{s}$ we have about $37\%$ of
the full charge ($3\unit{C}$ in this case).

\begin{Note}
The observant student might worry that our equation gives values for very
large values of $t.$ Does the capacitor ever fully discharge? Well, yes it
does. Remember that we have a minimum charge of $1.6\times 10^{-19}\unit{C}$
because that is the charge of our charge carrier. We can't have less charge
than that. So when our equation gives $q<1.6\times 10^{-19}\unit{C},$ we
will remember that it must really be $q=0$.

\section{Meters}

\subsection{Ammeters}

Suppose we wanted to know how much water flowed through our pipes in our
water system.

\FRAME{dtbpF}{3.5146in}{1.977in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

meter. The flow meter has to have the water flow through it in order to tell
how much water has gone by.

The same is true for measuring current. The meter must be \emph{in the
circuit} to measure the current because the current has to go through the
meter to me measured. The meter that measures current is called an ammeter,
and ideally the ammeter will not have any resistance. You might guess that
this is hard to achieve. in practice. Well, in the circuit above we have an
ammeter measuring the current through two resisters. The current should be 
\begin{equation}
I=\frac{\mathcal{E}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}
\end{equation}%
but we know that there must be some resistance from the ammeter, so 
\begin{equation}
I=\frac{\mathcal{E}}{R_{1}+R_{2}+R_{a}}
\end{equation}%
where $R_{a}$ is the resistance due to the ammeter. Suppose all three
resistances are the same, then with no ammeter we would have%
\begin{equation}
I=\frac{\mathcal{E}}{2R}
\end{equation}%
but with the ammeter%
\begin{equation}
I^{\prime }=\frac{\mathcal{E}}{3R}
\end{equation}%
which gives a percent change of 
\begin{equation}
\frac{I-I^{\prime }}{I^{\prime }}=\frac{\frac{\mathcal{E}}{2R}-\frac{%
\mathcal{E}}{3R}}{\frac{\mathcal{E}}{3R}}=\allowbreak 0.5
\end{equation}%
or on the order of $50\%!$ Usually $R_{a}$ is designed to be very small, but
you need to know your meter to know how much to trust it when you seek to
measure circuits with low resistance.

\subsection{Voltmeters}

Suppose we wanted to know how much potential energy lose when the water
moves from the middle tank to the lower tank. What would we do?

\FRAME{dtbpF}{4.5671in}{2.565in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language
"Scientific Word";type "GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio TRUE;display

"1";cropright "1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename
'N8ESCZ7V.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}Well, I think we would measure
the distance from the lower tank to the middle tank, and then multiply by $%
mg.$ The potential would be 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta U=mg(y_{2}-y_{1})
\end{equation*}%
Notice that to measure potential energy we have to make \emph{two}
measurements, one at $y_{1}$ and one at $y_{2}.$ This is always true for a
potential energy \emph{difference}. The same is true for electric potential.
But we don't use a ruler to measure electric potential. We use a volt meter.

\FRAME{dtbpF}{2.4102in}{1.868in}{0in}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language
"Scientific Word";type "GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio TRUE;display

"1";cropright "1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename
'N8ESD07W.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}

Notice that to measure the voltage drop for the lower resister we need two
measurements on either side of the resister.

Really the meter measures a small current flowing through a very large
resistor inside the meter. Ideally, a voltmeter would have infinite
resistance. Of course it is difficult to achieve an infinite resistance, so
we have to make due with smaller, finite, resistances. We can see that if $%
R_{V}$ of the voltmeter is not much larger than $R_{2},$ then it will change
the current through $R_{2}.$ Since 
\begin{equation}
\Delta V=RI
\end{equation}%
the current should be 
\begin{equation}
\Delta V=R_{2}I
\end{equation}%
were we can find $I$%
\begin{equation}
I=\frac{\mathcal{E}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}
\end{equation}%
but suppose the voltmeter has a resistance equal to $R_{2}.$ Then, from the
loop rule, 
\begin{equation}
I=I_{2}+I_{V}
\end{equation}%
where $I_{2}$ will go through $R_{2}$ and $I_{V}$ will go through the
voltmeter. Since the resistances are the same, we expect $I_{2}=I_{V}$. so
now 
\begin{equation}
I_{2}=\frac{I}{2}
\end{equation}%
Then 
\begin{equation}
\Delta V=R_{2}I_{2}=\frac{IR_{2}}{2}
\end{equation}%
or half the value we expected!

A too-small resistance will change the voltage it is trying to measure.
Again, you must know your meter before you attempt to make the measurement
across elements with large resistances.

\section{Household Circuits}

Many of you may have worked on new homes and may understand household wiring
quite well. I am just going to give a high level overview.\FRAME{dtbpF}{%

Electrical power enters our homes through a meter (so the power company can
charge us) and is divided into several major circuits. Each circuit is
designed according to what is likely to be done in the room it services.
Bedrooms likely will require less power than kitchens, for example. Each
circuit has a \emph{circuit breaker}. This devices senses when too much
current is flowing and stops the flow to the entire circuit before wires can
heat an pose a danger.

Usually only one of the wires entering the home carries current. We call
this the \emph{live wire}. The other is neutral and represents our home zero
potential point. For larger appliances, we often will have a third wire that
represents a large negative potential as well.

In modern electrical outlets, there are also three wires. One is called the 
\emph{ground} wire. The chassis of many electrical devices are connected to
this ground wire. If there is a malfunction such that the live wire is
accidently connected to the device, the electrical current is more likely to
travel though the ground wire. This is good because relatively small
currents (\TEXTsymbol{<}$100\unit{mA}$) can be fatal!

\item The Earth has a magnetic field

\item Magnets have \textquotedblleft magnetic charge

\item Magnetic poles don't seem to exist independently

\item A long wire that carries a current produces a magnetic field

\item The magnetic field due to a long wither with current becomes weaker
with distance and forms concentric cylinders of constant magnetic field
strength

\item The direction of the long-wire-with-current field is given by a
right-hand-rule.

\item The field due to a moving charge is given by the \emph{Biot-Savart law}%

Most people have used a magnet. at some time. They come as ads that stick to
a refrigerator. They are the working part of a compass. They hold the pieces
of travel games to their boards, etc. So I think we all know that magnets
stick to metal things. But do they stick to all metal things?

The answer is no, only a few metals work. Iron and Nickel and Cobalt are
some that do. Aluminum and Copper do not. By the time we are done studying
magnetism, we should be able to explain this.

Magnets are very like charged objects in some ways. They can attract or
repel each other They attract \textquotedblleft
unmagnetized\textquotedblright\ materials. But there are some important
differences.

Notice that a \textquotedblleft magnetic charge\textquotedblright\ seems to
be induced in some metal objects, but not in other common objects. This is
very different than electric charge and electric polarization! And we should
state explicitly that for magnets, there seem to be both \textquotedblleft
charges\textquotedblright\ in the same object! We call the \textquotedblleft
charge centers\textquotedblright\ the \emph{poles} of the magnet. We find
that one pole attracts one of the poles of a second magnet and repels the
other. If we turn around the first magnet, we find that our pattern of
attraction and repulsion reverses.%

Because magnets were used for centuries in navigational compasses, we call
one pole the \emph{north pole} of the compass and the other the \emph{south
pole} of the magnet. The north pole is the pole that would orient toward the
north. Why does this happen?

I hope your high school science class taught you that the Earth has a
magnetic field. \FRAME{dhF}{4.0119in}{1.8213in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special%

influence of a large magnet! Now lets hang both of our magnets from a
string, and see which way they like to hang. The north facing end we will
label $N$ and the south facing end we will label $S.$ Now we can see that
the two $N$ ends repel each other and the two $S$ ends repel each other. But
a $N$ end and a $S$ end will attract.

where we can define a mover object and an environmental object. We can
picture one of the magnets making a magnetic field and the other magnet
moving through this field. Of course both magnets make magnetic fields, but
since a magnet can't make a magnetic field that moves itself, we won't draw
this self-field for the mover magnet. We just draw the field for the
environmental magnet. We did this in our Earth-compass picture. The Earth
was the environmental magnet and the compass was the mover magnet.

One quirk of history is that since a $N$ end of a magnet is attracted to the
North part of the Earth. But north end of magnets are attracted to south
poles of magnets, the Earth's geographic north pole must be a magnetic south
pole!

One common misconception is that there is one specific place that is the
magnetic north pole. Really it is a region near Newfoundland where the field
strength actually varies quite a bit. You may have heard people discuss how
the poles switch every so often. This is true, and we don't fully understand
the mechanism for this.

There is a large difference between the magnetic force and the electric
force. Electric charges are easy to separate. But magnetic poles are not at
all easy to separate. If we break a magnet\FRAME{dhF}{1.7495in}{1.1217in}{0pt%

something about the source of the magnetic field must be very different than
for the source of the electric field. We will investigate the source of a
magnetic field as we go.

The Earth's magnetic fields affects many biological systems. One of these is
a bacteria that contain small permanent magnets inside of them to help them
find the mud they live in.

In the 1990's there was a health fad involving magnets. Many people bought
magnets to strap on their bodies. They were supposed to reduce aging and
give energy. Mostly they stimulated the economy. But we will find that
magnetic fields can alter the flow of blood (but these magnets did not do
so, the FDA would not allow strong enough magnets to be sold as apparel to
have this effect). Another common place to find magnetic fields is the MRI
devices used in hospitals to make images of the interior of bodies.

We have now experience with two non-contact forces, the gravitational force
and the electric or Coulomb force. In both cases, we have found that there
is a field involved with the production of this force. We can guess that
this is true for the magnetic force as well.

The discovery of this field involved an accidental experiment, and
understanding this experiment gives us great insight into the nature of this
field and where it comes from. So we will spend a little time describing it.

In 1819 a Dutch scientist named Oersted was lecturing on electricity. He was
actually making the point that there was no connection between electricity
and magnetism. He had a large battery connected to a wire. A large current
flowed through the wire. By chance, Oersted placed a compass near the wire.
He had done this before, but this time the wire was in a different
orientation than in previous demonstrations. To his great surprise, the
compass needle changed direction when it was placed near the wire!

A similar experiment, but this time with several compasses, is shown in the
next figure.

We know that a compass orients itself in the Earth's magnetic field. We can
infer that the compass needle will orient in any magnetic field. In the next
figure you can see that there is a force on each end of the needle due to
the magnetic field.

environmental magnetic field with the letter $B.$ This is traditional.
Magnetic fields are often called $B$-fields for this reason. But more
importantly, this looks very like an electric dipole in a constant electric
field. We know enough about the dipole situation to predict that there will
be a torque, and that there will be a stable equilibrium when the compass
needle is aligned with the magnetic field.

Since our compasses oriented themselves near the current carrying wire,
there must be a magnetic field caused by the current in the wire. The field
shown in the last figure is uniform, but the field of our wire cannot be
uniform. The compasses pointed different directions. A common way to
describe this field is with a right-hand-rule. We imagine grabbing the wire
with our right hand with our thumb pointing in the current direction. The
field direction is given by our fingers.\FRAME{dhF}{1.8083in}{1.8862in}{0pt}{%

when $r=\infty .$ So the field fills all of space.\FRAME{dhF}{2.5019in}{%

draw the magnetic field due to a long straight wire, but it takes a long
time to draw such a diagram, so usually we will just draw one circle, and
you will have to mentally fill in the other circles and the concentric
cylinders that they represent.

To use the right hand rule, remember to place your thumb in the current
direction. Then the field direction is given tangent to the circle and
pointing in our finger direction.

\subsection{Making the field--moving charges}

But how does a current in a wire make a magnetic field?

The secret is to look at the individual charges that are moving. When early
scientists caused individual charges to move, they found they created
magnetic fields. The experimental results gave a relationship for the
strength of this field%
\begin{equation*}
B=\frac{\mu _{o}}{4\pi }\frac{qv\sin \theta }{r^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
and the direction is given by the right hand rule by pointing the thumb in
the direction the charges are going and using the figures to indicate the
field direction as we have described above. In a sense, this is a very small
current (one moving charge!). So the field should look very similar.

This relationship was found by two scientists, Biot and Savart, and it
carries their name, the \emph{Biot-Savart law.}

The factor $\mu _{o}$ is a constant very like $\epsilon _{o}.$ It has a
value 
\begin{equation*}
\mu _{o}=4\pi \times 10^{-7}\frac{\unit{T}\unit{m}}{\unit{A}}
\end{equation*}%
and is called the \emph{permeability of free space, }The unit $\unit{T}$ is
called a \emph{tesla} and is 
\begin{equation*}
\unit{T}=\frac{\unit{N}}{\unit{A}\unit{m}}
\end{equation*}

The charges already had an electric field before they were accelerated, but
now they have two fields, an electric and a magnetic field.

We used unit vectors to write our $E$-field.%
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{q}{r^{2}}%
\mathbf{\hat{r}}
\end{equation*}%
It is convenient to do the same for the magnetic case. We can remember that
a vector cross product is given by 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{a}}\times \overrightarrow{\mathbf{b}}=ab\sin \theta
\qquad \perp \overrightarrow{\mathbf{a}},\perp \overrightarrow{\mathbf{b}}
\end{equation*}%
where the resulting vector is perpendicular to both $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{%
a}}$ and $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{b}}.$ Thinking about this for a while
allows us to realize this is just what we want for the magnetic field. If
the velocity of the charges is up (say, in the $\hat{z}$ direction) then we
can use our right hand rule to realize we need a vector perpendicular to
both $\hat{z}$ and $\hat{r}.$ This is given by 
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{\hat{z}}\times \mathbf{\hat{r}}
\end{equation*}%
which is always tangent to the circle indicated by our fingers. Since $v$ is
in the $z$ direction we can use%
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}\times \mathbf{\hat{r}}=v\sin \theta \qquad \perp 
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}},\perp \mathbf{\hat{r}}
\end{equation*}%
to write the Biot-Savart law as 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}=\frac{\mu _{o}}{4\pi }\frac{q\overrightarrow{%
\mathbf{v}}\times \mathbf{\hat{r}}}{r^{2}}
\end{equation*}

We should do a problem to see how this works.

Suppose we accelerate a proton and send it in the $z$-direction to a speed
of $1.0\times 10^{7}\unit{m}/\unit{s}.$ Let's further suppose we have a
magnetic field detector placed $1\unit{mm}$ from the path of the proton.
What field would it measure?

We know 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}=\frac{\mu _{o}}{4\pi }\frac{q\overrightarrow{%

\end{equation*}%
and by symmetry we know that $v$ is perpendicular to $\hat{r}$ just as the
proton passes the detector. So, using the right hand rule for cross
products, we put our hand in the $v$-direction and bend our fingers into the 
$r$-direction. Then our thumb shows the resulting direction. In this case it
is in the positive $y$-direction, or out of the page. The magnitude would be 
\begin{eqnarray*}

\item The magnetic field due to a current in a wire is given by the integral
form of the Biot-Savart law $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}=\frac{\mu _{o}I}{%

\section{Magnetic field of a current}

Last lecture, we learned the Biot-Savart law%
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}=\frac{\mu _{o}}{4\pi }\frac{q\overrightarrow{%
\mathbf{v}}\times \mathbf{\hat{r}}}{r^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
now let's consider our $q$ to be part of a current in a wire. A small amount
of current moves along the wire. Let's call this small amount of charge $%
\Delta Q.$ \FRAME{dhF}{3.2292in}{2.1344in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special%

make a magnetic field, but it will be only a small part of the total field,
because $\Delta Q$ is only a small part of the total amount of charge
flowing in the wire. That part of the field made by $\Delta Q$ is 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}=\frac{\mu _{o}}{4\pi }\frac{\Delta Q%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}\times \mathbf{\hat{r}}}{r^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
Let's look at $\Delta Q\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}.$ We can rewrite this as 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta Q\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}} &=&\Delta Q\frac{\Delta \overrightarrow{%
\mathbf{s}}}{\Delta t} \\
&=&\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}\Delta \overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}} \\
&=&I\Delta \overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
then our small amount of field is given by 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}=\frac{\mu _{o}}{4\pi }\frac{I\Delta 
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}\times \mathbf{\hat{r}}}{r^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
as usual, where there is a $\Delta ,$ we can predict that we can take a
limit and end up with a $d$%
\begin{equation*}
d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}=\frac{\mu _{o}}{4\pi }\frac{Id\overrightarrow{%

The magnitude of $d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}$ is proportional to $\sin
\theta $ where $\theta $ is the angle between $d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}$
and $\mathbf{\hat{r}}$
\end{enumerate}

Where there is $d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}$ we will surely integrate. The
field $d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}$ is due to just a small part of the wire 
$d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}.$ We would like the field due to all of the
wire. So we take 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}=\frac{\mu _{o}I}{4\pi }\int \frac{d%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}\times \mathbf{\hat{r}}}{r^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
This is a case where the equation actually is as hard to deal with as it
looks. The integration over a cross product is tricky. Let's do an example.

\subsection{The field due to a square current loop}

Suppose we have a square current loop. Of course there would have to be a
battery or some potential source in the loop to make the current, but we
will just draw the loop with a current as shown. The current must be the
same in all parts of the loop.\FRAME{dhF}{1.8447in}{1.9389in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure%

Let's find the field in the center of the loop at point $P$.

I will break up the integration into four parts, one for each side of the
loop. For each part, we will need to find $d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}%
\times \mathbf{\hat{r}}$ and $r$ to find the field using%
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}=\frac{\mu _{o}I}{4\pi }\int \frac{d%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}\times \mathbf{\hat{r}}}{r^{2}}
\end{equation*}

This is very like what we did to find electric fields. For electric fields
we had to find $dq,$ $\mathbf{\hat{r}},$ and $r$ and we integrated using 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\int \frac{dq}{r^{2}}%
\mathbf{\hat{r}}
\end{equation*}

Now we need $d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}\times \mathbf{\hat{r}}$ and $r.$
For electric fields, we needed to deal with the vector $\mathbf{\hat{r}.}$
Now we need to deal with a cross product, $d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}%
\times \mathbf{\hat{r}}$, involving $\mathbf{\hat{r}.}$

For the bottom part of our loop $d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}\times \mathbf{%
\hat{r}}$ is just%
\begin{eqnarray*}
d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}\times \mathbf{\hat{r}} &=&-ds\sin \theta 
\mathbf{\hat{k}} \\
&=&-dx\sin \theta \mathbf{\hat{k}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
We can see this in the figure\FRAME{dtbpF}{1.3716in}{1.6466in}{0pt}{}{}{%

1.6103in;cropleft "0";croptop "1";cropright "1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename
'N8ESD28G.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}so our field from the bottom wire
is 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}_{b} &=&\frac{\mu _{o}I}{4\pi }\int \frac{d%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}\times \mathbf{\hat{r}}}{r^{2}} \\
&=&\frac{\mu _{o}I}{4\pi }\int \frac{-dx\sin \theta \mathbf{\hat{k}}}{r^{2}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
But we need to find $r.$ From trigonometry we realize 
\begin{equation*}
\sin \theta =\frac{a}{r}
\end{equation*}%
on the right side of the wire, and 
\begin{equation*}
\sin \left( \pi -\theta \right) =\sin \theta =\frac{a}{r}
\end{equation*}%
on the left, thus 
\begin{equation*}
r=\frac{a}{\sin \theta }
\end{equation*}%
then our field equation for the bottom wire becomes%
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}_{b}=\frac{\mu _{o}I}{4\pi }\int \frac{-\left(
dx\right) \sin \theta \mathbf{\hat{k}}}{\left( \frac{a}{\sin \theta }\right)
^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
but now we have an integration over $dx$ and our function is in terms of $%
\theta $ which depends on $x.$ We should try to fix this. Let's find $dx$ in
terms of $d\theta .$ We can pick $x=0$ to be the middle of the wire. Then 
\begin{equation*}
\tan \theta =\frac{a}{x}
\end{equation*}%
on the right and\FRAME{dtbpF}{1.7573in}{1.8957in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special%

\begin{equation*}
\tan \left( \pi -\theta \right) =-\tan \theta =\frac{a}{x}
\end{equation*}%
on the left. Since on the left $x$ is negative, this makes sense. So we have
either 
\begin{equation*}
x=\frac{a}{\tan \theta }
\end{equation*}%
or 
\begin{equation*}
x=-\frac{a}{\tan \theta }
\end{equation*}%
depending on which size of the dotted line we are on. We could write these
as 
\begin{equation*}
x=\pm \frac{a}{\tan \theta }=\pm \frac{a\cos \theta }{\sin \theta }
\end{equation*}%
for both cases. We really want $dx$ and moreover we want it as a magnitude
(we deal with the direction in the cross product). So we can take a
derivative and then take the magnitude (absolute value).%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dx}{d\theta }=\frac{\sin \theta \left( -a\sin \theta \right) -a\cos
\theta \cos \theta }{\sin ^{2}\theta }=\frac{-a}{\sin ^{2}\theta }
\end{equation*}%
This derivative was not obvious! We had to use the quotient rule. But once
we have found it we can rewrite this as 
\begin{equation*}
dx=\left\vert \frac{-a}{\sin ^{2}\theta }d\theta \right\vert
\end{equation*}%
(now with the absolute value inserted) and since neither $a$ nor $\sin
^{2}\theta $ can be negative we can just write this as%
\begin{equation*}
dx=\frac{a}{\sin ^{2}\theta }d\theta
\end{equation*}%
Then our field for the bottom wire is 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}_{b}=\frac{\mu _{o}I}{4\pi }\int \frac{-\left( 
\frac{a}{\sin ^{2}\theta }\right) d\theta \sin \theta \mathbf{\hat{k}}}{%
\left( \frac{a}{\sin \theta }\right) ^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
which we should simplify before we try to integrate. 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}_{b} &=&\frac{\mu _{o}I}{4\pi }\int \frac{-\sin
\theta d\theta \mathbf{\hat{k}}}{a} \\
&=&-\frac{\mu _{o}I}{4\pi a}\mathbf{\hat{k}}\int \sin \theta d\theta
\end{eqnarray*}%
which is really not too bad considering the integral we had at the start of
this problem. When we get to the corner of the left hand side $\theta =\frac{%
3\pi }{4}$ and when we start on the right hand side $\theta =\frac{\pi }{4}$
and along the bottom wire $\theta $ will be somewhere in between $\frac{\pi 
}{4}$ and $\frac{3\pi }{4}.$ Then $\frac{\pi }{4}$ and $\frac{3\pi }{4}$ are
our limits of integration. We can perform this integral 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}_{b} &=&-\frac{\mu _{o}I}{4\pi a}\mathbf{\hat{k}}%
\int_{\frac{\pi }{4}}^{\frac{3\pi }{4}}\sin \theta d\theta \\
&=&-\frac{\mu _{o}I}{4\pi a}\mathbf{\hat{k}}\left[ -\cos \theta \mathstrut
\right\vert _{\frac{\pi }{4}}^{\frac{3\pi }{4}} \\
&=&-\frac{\mu _{o}I}{4\pi a}\mathbf{\hat{k}}\left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}-\left(
-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) \right) \\
&=&-\frac{\mu _{o}I\sqrt{2}}{4\pi a}\mathbf{\hat{k}}
\end{eqnarray*}

This was just for the bottom of the loop. Now let's look at the top of the
loop. There is finally some good news. The math will all be the same except
for the directions. We had better work out $d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}%
\times \mathbf{\hat{r}}$ to see how different it is.

Now the $d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}$ is to the right and $\mathbf{\hat{r}}$
is downward so%
\begin{equation*}
d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}\times \mathbf{\hat{r}}=-dx\sin \theta \mathbf{%
\hat{k}}
\end{equation*}%
But this is just as before. So even this is the same! The integral across
the top wire will have exactly the same result as the integral across the
bottom wire. We can just multiply our previous result by two.

How about the sides? Again we get the same $d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}%
\times \mathbf{\hat{r}}$ direction and all the rest is the same, so our
total field is 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}=4\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}_{b}=-\frac{\mu _{o}I%
\sqrt{2}}{\pi a}\mathbf{\hat{k}}
\end{equation*}

This was a long hard, messy problem. But current loops are important! Every
electric circuit is a current loop. Does this mean that every circuit is
making a magnetic field?

The answer is yes! As you might guess, this can have a profound effect on
circuit design. If your circuit is very sensitive, adding extra fields (and
therefore extra forces on the charges) can be disastrous causing the design
to fail. There is some concern about \textquotedblleft electronic
noise\textquotedblright\ and possible effects on the body (cataracts are one
side effect that is well known). And of course, as the circuit changes its
current, the field it creates changes. this can create the opportunity for
espionage. The field exists far away from the circuit. A savvy spy can
determine what your circuit is doing by watching the field change!

\subsection{Long Straight wires}

In our last example, we found that the magnitude of the field due to a wire
is 
\begin{equation*}
B=\left\vert -\frac{\mu _{o}I}{4\pi a}\int \sin \theta d\theta \right\vert
\end{equation*}%
Of course, we would like to relate this to our standard charge
configuration, in this case an infinite line of (now moving) charge. If the
wire is infinitely long, then the limits of integration are just from $%
\theta =0$ to $\theta =\pi $ 
\begin{eqnarray*}
B &=&\left\vert -\frac{\mu _{o}I}{4\pi a}\int_{0}^{\pi }\sin \theta d\theta
\right\vert \\
&=&\left\vert -\left. \frac{\mu _{o}I}{4\pi a}\left( -\cos \theta \right)
\right\vert _{0}^{\pi }\right\vert \\
&=&\frac{\mu _{o}I}{2\pi a}
\end{eqnarray*}%
This is an important result. We can add a new geometry to our list of
special cases, a long straight wire that is carrying a current $I.$ The
direction of the magnetic field, we already know, is given by our
right-hand-rule. Of course, if our wire is not infinitely long, we now know
how to find the actual field. It is all a matter of finding the right limits
of integration.

As a second example, let's find the magnetic field due to a round loop at
the center of the loop. We start again with%
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}=\frac{\mu _{o}I}{4\pi }\int \frac{d%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}\times \mathbf{\hat{r}}}{r^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
We need to find $d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}\times \mathbf{\hat{r}}$ and $r$%
, to do the integration. Our steps are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find an expression for $d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}\times \mathbf{%
\hat{r},}$ this is a vector

\item Find an expression for $r$

\item Turn three-dimensional problems into three one-dimensional problems by
taking components

\item Assemble the integral, including limits of integration

\item Solve the integral.
\end{enumerate}

Let's start with the first step. As we go around the loop $d\overrightarrow{%
\mathbf{s}}$ and $\mathbf{\hat{r}}$ will be perpendicular to each other, so 
\begin{equation*}
d\mathbf{s}\times \mathbf{\hat{r}}=ds\mathbf{\hat{k}}
\end{equation*}%
For the second step, we realize that $r$ is just the radius of the loop, $R$%
. Then the integration is quite easy (much easier to set up than the last
case!) 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{B}=\frac{\mu _{o}I}{4\pi }\int \frac{ds}{R^{2}}\mathbf{\hat{k%
}}
\end{equation*}%
The limits of integration will be $0$ to $2\pi R.$ Notice that this is
really a one-dimensional problem! $B$ is a vector that points in the $%
\mathbf{\hat{k}}$ direction only. So we don't need to take components. Or in
other words, we already know $B_{x}$ and $B_{y}$ are zero for this case. We
can perform this integral 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\overrightarrow{B} &=&\frac{\mu _{o}I}{4\pi }\int_{0}^{2\pi R}\frac{ds}{R^{2}%
}\mathbf{\hat{k}} \\
&=&\frac{\mu _{o}I}{4\pi }\frac{2\pi R}{R^{2}}\mathbf{\hat{k}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
so%
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{B}=\frac{\mu _{o}I}{2R}\mathbf{\hat{k}}\text{ \qquad loop}
\end{equation*}%
The field is perpendicular to the plane of the loop, which agrees with our
square loop problem.\FRAME{dtbpF}{4.2903in}{2.7071in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{%

Let's extend this problem to a point along the axis a distance $z$ away from
the loop. Starting with step $1,$ we realize that, in general, our value of $%
d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}\times \mathbf{\hat{r}}$ is 
\begin{equation*}
d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}\times \mathbf{\hat{r}}=ds\sin \phi

\begin{equation*}

with a direction shown in the figure. But our value of $r$ is now more
complicated%
\begin{equation*}
r=\sqrt{R^{2}+z^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
We have used symmetry to argue that we can take just $x$ or $y$-components
in the past because all the others clearly canceled out. We can also do that
again here.

Using symmetry we see that only the $z$-component of the magnetic field will
survive. So we can take the projection onto the $z$-axis. 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}=\frac{\mu _{o}I}{4\pi }\int \frac{ds}{r^{2}}\cos
\theta \mathbf{\hat{k}}
\end{equation*}%
We know how to deal with such a situation, since we have done this before.
From the diagram we can see that 
\begin{equation*}
\cos \theta =\frac{R}{\sqrt{R^{2}+z^{2}}}
\end{equation*}%
so our field becomes%
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}=\frac{\mu _{o}I}{4\pi }\mathbf{\hat{k}}\int 
\frac{Rds}{\left( R^{2}+z^{2}\right) ^{\frac{3}{2}}}
\end{equation*}%
This is also a one-dimensional problem with $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}$
only in the $\mathbf{\hat{k}}$ direction. Fortunately this integral is also
not too hard to do. Let's take out all the terms that don't change with $ds$%
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}=\frac{\mu _{o}IR}{4\pi \left( R^{2}+z^{2}\right)
^{\frac{3}{2}}}\mathbf{\hat{k}}\int_{0}^{2\pi R}ds
\end{equation*}%
The limits of integration are $0$ to $2\pi R$, the circumference of the
circle%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}} &=&\frac{\mu _{o}IR2\pi R}{4\pi \left(
R^{2}+z^{2}\right) ^{\frac{3}{2}}}\mathbf{\hat{k}} \\
&=&\frac{\mu _{o}IR^{2}}{2\left( R^{2}+z^{2}\right) ^{\frac{3}{2}}}\mathbf{%
\hat{k}}
\end{eqnarray*}

Let's take some limiting cases to see if this makes sense. Suppose $z=0,$
then%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}} &=&\frac{\mu _{o}IR^{2}}{2\left( R^{2}+0\right)
^{\frac{3}{2}}}\mathbf{\hat{k}} \\
&=&\frac{\mu _{o}IR^{2}}{2R^{3}}\mathbf{\hat{k}} \\
&=&\frac{\mu _{o}I}{2R}\mathbf{\hat{k}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
which is what we got before for the field at the center of the loop. That is
comforting.

Now suppose that $z\gg R.$ In that case, we can ignore the $R^{2}$ in the
denominator.%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}} &\approx &\frac{\mu _{o}IR^{2}}{2\left(
z^{2}\right) ^{\frac{3}{2}}}\mathbf{\hat{k}} \\
&=&\frac{\mu _{o}IR^{2}}{2z^{3}}\mathbf{\hat{k}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
We have just done this for on-axis positions because the math is easy there.
But we could find the field at other locations. The result looks something

that the field is up through the loop, and down on the outside.

As we generalize our solution for the magnetic field far from the loop we
have%
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}\approx \frac{\mu _{o}IR^{2}}{2r^{3}}\mathbf{\hat{%
k}}
\end{equation*}

This looks a lot like the electric field from a dipole%
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}=\frac{2}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{p}}}{r^{3}}
\end{equation*}%
which gives us an idea. We have a dipole moment for the electric dipole.
This magnetic field has the same basic form as the electric dipole. We can
rewrite our field as%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}} &\approx &\frac{\mu _{o}I\left( \pi R^{2}\right) 
}{2\left( \pi \right) r^{3}}\mathbf{\hat{\imath}} \\

&=&\frac{\mu _{o}}{4\pi }\frac{2IA}{r^{3}}\mathbf{\hat{\imath}}

where $A=\pi R^{2}$ is the area of the loop.

The electric dipole moment is the charge multiplied by the charge separation

p=qa

we have something like that in our magnetic field, The terms $IA$ describe
the amount of charge and the geometry of the charges. We will call these

As we get farther from a loop, the exact shape of the loop becomes less

The integral for of the Biot-Savart law is very powerful. We can use
computers to calculate the field do to any type of current configuration.
But by hand there are only a few cases we can do because the integration
becomes difficult. With electrostatics, we found ways to use geometry to
eliminate or at least make the integration simpler. We will do the same
thing for magnetostatics starting with the next lecture. Our goal will be to
use geometry to avoid using Biot-Savart when we can.

\section{Ampere's Law}

The Biot-Savart law is a powerful technique for finding a magnetic field,
but it is more powerful numerically than in closed-form problems. We can
only find exact solutions to a few problems with special symmetry. Since
problems we can do by hand require special symmetry anyway, we would like to
use symmetry as much as possible to remove the need for difficult
integration.

We saw this situation before with electrostatics. We did some integration to
find fields from charge distributions, but then we learned Gauss' law, and
that was easier because it turned hard integration problems into relatively
easy ones. This still required special symmetry, but when it worked, it was
a fantastic time saver. For non-symmetric problems, there is always the
integration method, and a computer.

Likewise, for magnetostatics there is an easier method. To see how it works,
let's review some math.

In the figure there is a line, divided up into many little segments. \FRAME{%
dhF}{2.2295in}{1.4555in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language "Scientific
Word";type "GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio TRUE;display "USEDEF";valid_file

"1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename 'N8ESD48Q.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}%
We can find the length of the line by adding up all the little segment
lengths 
\begin{equation*}
L=\sum_{i}\Delta s_{i}
\end{equation*}%
Integration would make this task less tedious%
\begin{equation*}
L=\int ds
\end{equation*}%
This is called a line integral. Our new method of finding magnetic fields
will involve line integrals. The calculation of the length is too simple,
however. We will have to integrate some quantity along the line. For
example, we could envision integrating the amount of energy lost when
pushing a box along a path. The integral would give the total energy loss.
The amount of energy lost would depend on the specific path. Thus a line
integral 
\begin{equation*}
W=\int \overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}
\end{equation*}%
would be useful to find the total amount of work. Each small line segment
would give a differential amount of work%
\begin{equation*}
dW=\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}
\end{equation*}%
and we use the integral to add up the contribution to the work for each
segment of size $ds$ along the path. Notice the dot product. We need the dot
product because only the component of the force in the direction the box is
going adds to the total work done.\FRAME{dhF}{3.5362in}{2.1767in}{0pt}{}{}{%

'N8ESD48R.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}

We wish to do a similar thing for our magnetic field. We wish to integrate
the magnetic field along a path. The integral would look like this%
\begin{equation*}
\int_{a}^{b}\overrightarrow{B}\cdot d\overrightarrow{s}
\end{equation*}%
This may not look like an improvement over integrating using the Biot-Savart
law, but our goal will be to use symmetry to make this integral very easy.
The key is in the dot product. We want only the component of the magnetic
field that is in the $d\overrightarrow{s_{i}}$ direction. There are two
special cases.

If the field is perpendicular to the $d\overrightarrow{s_{i}}$ direction,
then 
\begin{equation*}
\int_{a}^{b}\overrightarrow{B}\cdot d\overrightarrow{s}=0
\end{equation*}%
because $\overrightarrow{B}\cdot d\overrightarrow{s_{i}}=0$ for this case

If the field is in the same direction as $d\overrightarrow{s_{i}},$ then $%
\overrightarrow{B}\cdot d\overrightarrow{s_{i}}=Bds$ and 
\begin{equation*}
\int_{a}^{b}\overrightarrow{B}\cdot d\overrightarrow{s}=\int_{a}^{b}Bds
\end{equation*}%
Further if we can make is so that $B$ is constant and everywhere tangent to
the path, then 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\int_{a}^{b}\overrightarrow{B}\cdot d\overrightarrow{s} &=&\int_{a}^{b}Bds \\
&=&B\int_{a}^{b}ds \\
&=&BL
\end{eqnarray*}%
This process should look familiar. We used similar arguments to make the
integral $\int \overrightarrow{E}\cdot d\overrightarrow{A}$ easy for Gauss'
law.

With Gaussian surfaces, we found we could imagine any surface we wanted. In
a similar way, for our line integral we can pick any path we want. if we can
make $B$ constant and everywhere tangent to the path, then, the integral
will be easy. It is important to realize that we get to make up our path.
There may be some physical thing along the path, but there is no need for
there to be. The paths we will use are imaginary.

Usually we will want our path to be around a closed loop. Let's take the
case of a long straight current-carrying wire. We know the field shape for
this. We can see that if we take a crazy path around the wire, that $%
\overrightarrow{B}\cdot \Delta \overrightarrow{s_{i}}$ will give us the
projection of $\overrightarrow{B}$ onto the $\Delta \overrightarrow{s_{i}}$
direction for each part of the path. \FRAME{dhF}{2.7259in}{2.5953in}{0pt}{}{%

\begin{equation*}
\sum_{i}B_{\Vert }\Delta s
\end{equation*}%
or in integral form 
\begin{equation*}
\int B_{\Vert }ds
\end{equation*}%
The strange shape I\ drew is not very convenient. This is neither the case
where $\overrightarrow{B}\cdot d\overrightarrow{s_{i}}=0$ nor where $%
\overrightarrow{B}\cdot d\overrightarrow{s_{i}}=Bds.$ But if we think for a
moment, I\ do know a shape where $\overrightarrow{B}\cdot d\overrightarrow{%
s_{i}}=Bds.$ If we choose a circle, then from symmetry $B$ will be constant,
and it will be in the same direction as $ds$ so$\overrightarrow{B}\cdot d%
\overrightarrow{s_{i}}=Bds$. From our last lecture we even know what the
field should be. 
\begin{equation*}
B=\frac{\mu _{o}I}{2\pi r}
\end{equation*}%
Let's see if we can use this to form a new general approach. Since $B$ is
constant around the loop, we can write our line integral as%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\int \overrightarrow{B}\cdot d\overrightarrow{s} &=&B2\pi r \\
&=&\frac{\mu _{o}I}{2\pi r}2\pi r \\
&=&\mu _{o}I
\end{eqnarray*}%
This is an amazingly simple result. We integrated the magnetic field around
an imaginary loop path, and got that the result is proportional to the
current in the wire. This reminds us of Gauss' law where we integrated the
electric field around a surface and got that the result is proportional to
the amount of charge inside the surface.

\begin{equation*}
\int \overrightarrow{E}\cdot d\overrightarrow{A}=\frac{Q_{in}}{\epsilon _{o}}
\end{equation*}

Let's review. Why did I\ pick a circle as my imaginary path? Because it made
my math easy! I\ don't want to do hard math to compute the field, so I\
tried to find a path over which the math was as easy as possible. Since the
path is imaginary, I\ can choose any path I\ want, so I\ chose a simple one.
I\ want a path where $\overrightarrow{B}\cdot d\overrightarrow{s_{i}}=0$ or
where $\overrightarrow{B}\cdot d\overrightarrow{s_{i}}=Bds.$ This is very
like picking Gaussian surfaces for Gauss' law. If I\ chose a harder path I\
would get the same answer, but it would take more effort. I found the result
of my integral $\int \overrightarrow{B}\cdot d\overrightarrow{s}$ to be just 
$\mu _{o}I.$

We had to integrate around a closed path, so I will change the integral sign
to indicate that we integrated over a closed path.

\begin{equation}
\oint \overrightarrow{B}\cdot d\overrightarrow{s}=\mu _{o}I_{through}
\end{equation}%
and only the current that went through the imaginary surface contributed to
the field, so we can mark the current as being the current that goes through
our imaginary closed path.

This process was first discovered by Ampere, so it is known as Ampere's law.

Let's use Ampere's law to do another problem. Suppose I have a coil of wire.
This coil is effectively a stack of current rings. We know the field from a
single ring.

\FRAME{dhF}{1.8118in}{1.6267in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

\begin{equation*}
B=\frac{\mu _{o}I}{2R}
\end{equation*}%
But what would the field be that is generated by having a current flow
through the coil?

Well, looking at the single loop picture, we see that the direction of the
field due to a loop is right through the middle of the loop. I think it is
reasonable to believe that if I place another loop on top of the one
pictured, that the fields would add, making a stronger field down the
middle. This is just what happens. So I could write our loop field equation
as%
\begin{equation*}
B=N\frac{\mu _{o}I}{2r}
\end{equation*}%
where $N$ is the number of loops I make. It is customary in electronics to
define $n$ as the number of loops per unit length (sort of like the linear
mass density we defined in waves on strings, only now it is linear loop
density). Suppose I take a lot of loops! In the picture I\ have drawn the
loops like a cross section of a spring. But now the loops are not all at the
same location. So we would guess that our field will be different than just $%
N$ times the field due to one loop. We can use Ampere's law to find this
field? \FRAME{dtbpF}{1.5731in}{1.7538in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

us on the LHS and is going back into the wires on the RHS. Remember our goal
is to use Ampere's law 
\begin{equation*}
\oint \overrightarrow{B}\cdot d\overrightarrow{s}=\mu _{o}I_{through}
\end{equation*}%
to find the field. Let's imagine a rectangular shaped \emph{Amperian} loop
shown as a dotted black line. Note that like Gaussian surfaces, this is an
imaginary loop. Nothing is really there along the loop. Let's look at the
integral by breaking it into four pieces, 
\begin{equation*}
\int_{1}\overrightarrow{B}\cdot d\overrightarrow{s}+\int_{2}\overrightarrow{B%
}\cdot d\overrightarrow{s}+\int_{3}\overrightarrow{B}\cdot d\overrightarrow{s%
}+\int_{4}\overrightarrow{B}\cdot d\overrightarrow{s}=\mu _{o}I_{through}
\end{equation*}%
one for each side of the loop. If I\ have chosen my loop carefully, then $%
\overrightarrow{B}\cdot d\overrightarrow{s_{i}}$ will either be $%
\overrightarrow{B}\cdot d\overrightarrow{s_{i}}=0$ or $\overrightarrow{B}%
\cdot d\overrightarrow{s_{i}}=Bds.$ Let's start with side $2$. We want to
consider 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{B}\cdot d\overrightarrow{s_{2}}
\end{equation*}%
We see that for our side $2$ the field is perpendicular to $d\overrightarrow{%
s_{2}}$ So 
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{B}\cdot d\ell _{2}=0
\end{equation*}%
This is great! I can integrate $0$ 
\begin{equation*}
\int 0=0
\end{equation*}%
The same reasoning applies to 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{B}\cdot d\overrightarrow{s_{4}}=0
\end{equation*}%
From our picture we can see that there is very little field outside of our
coil of loops. So $B_{3}$ is very small, so $\overrightarrow{B}\cdot d%
\overrightarrow{s_{3}}\approx 0.$ It is not exactly zero, but it is small
enough that I\ will call it negligible for this problem. For an infinite
coil, this would be exactly true (but infinite coils are hard to build).

That leaves path $1.$ There the $B$-field is in the same direction as $d%
\overrightarrow{s_{1}}$ so 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{B}\cdot d\overrightarrow{s_{1}}=Bds_{1}
\end{equation*}%
Again this is great! $B$ is fairly uniform along the coil. Let's say it is
close enough to be considered constant. Then the integral is easy over side $%
1$%
\begin{equation*}
\int Bds_{1}=B\ell
\end{equation*}%
We have performed the integral!%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\oint \overrightarrow{B}\cdot d\overrightarrow{s} &=&\int_{1}\overrightarrow{%
B}\cdot d\overrightarrow{s}+\int_{2}\overrightarrow{B}\cdot d\overrightarrow{%
s}+\int_{3}\overrightarrow{B}\cdot d\overrightarrow{s}+\int_{4}%
\overrightarrow{B}\cdot d\overrightarrow{s} \\
&=&B\ell +0+0+0 \\
&=&B\ell
\end{eqnarray*}

Now we need to find the current in the loop. This is more tricky than it
might appear. It is not just $I$ because we have several loops that go
through our loop, each on it's own carrying current $I$ and each
contributing to the field. We can use a linear loop density\footnote{%
Physicists like densities!} $n$ to find the number of loops.%
\begin{equation*}
N=n\ell
\end{equation*}%
and the current inside the loop will be 
\begin{equation*}
I_{inside}=NI
\end{equation*}%
Then, putting the integration all together, we have 
\begin{equation*}
\oint \overrightarrow{B}\cdot d\overrightarrow{s}=B\ell +0+0+0=\mu _{o}NI
\end{equation*}%
or%
\begin{equation*}
B\ell =\mu _{o}NI
\end{equation*}%
which gives a field of 
\begin{equation*}
B=\mu _{o}\frac{N}{\ell }I
\end{equation*}%
or%
\begin{equation*}
B=\mu _{o}nI

This device is so useful it has a name. It is a solenoid. You may have made
a coil as a kid and turned it into an electromagnet by hooking it to a
battery (a source of potential difference) so that a current ran through it.
In engineering solenoids are used as current controlled magnetic switches.%

There is another great thing about a solenoid. In the middle of the
solenoid, the field is really nearly constant. Near the ends, there are edge
effects, but in the middle we have a very uniform field. This is analogous
to the nearly uniform electric field inside a capacitor. We can therefore
see how to generate uniform magnetic fields and consider uniform $B$-fields
in problems. Such a large nearly uniform magnetic field is part of the
Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at CERN.

\section{Magnetic Force on a moving charge}

Now that we know how to generate a magnetic field, we can return to thinking
about magnetic forces on mover charges. Our magnetic field is slightly more
complicated than the electric field. We can still use a charge and the
force, but now the charge is moving so we expect to have to include the
velocity of the charge. We want an expression that relates $B$ and $F_{mag}$
in both magnitude and direction.

Our expression for the relationship between charge, velocity, field and the
force comes from experiment (although now we can derive it). The experiments
show that when a charged particle moves parallel to the magnetic field,
there is no force! This is radically different from our $E$-field! Worse
yet, the force seems to be perpendicular to both $v$ and $B$ when the angle
between them is not zero! Here is our expression. 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{F}_{B}=q\mathbf{v}\times \mathbf{B}
\end{equation}%
where $q$ is the mover charge and $B$ is the magnetic field environment.

We have a device that can shoot out electrons. The electrons show up because
they hit a phosphorescent screen. When we bring a magnet close to our beam
of electrons, we find it moves!%

But we did this with moving electrons, what happens if they are not moving?
We might expect the electrons to accelerate just the same--and we would be
wrong! Static charges seem to not notice the presence of the magnet at all!

We expect that, like gravity and electric charge, the force on the moving
electrons must be due to a field, but this \emph{magnetic field} does not
accelerate stationary electrons. We learned before that the reason we know
that there is some force on the electrons came when Oersted, a Dutch
scientist experimenting with electric current, found that his compass acted
strangely when it was near a wire carrying electric current. This discovery
is backwards of our experiment. It implies that moving charges must effect
magnets, but given Newton's third law, If moving electrons make a field that
makes a force on a magnet, then we would expect a magnet will make a field
that makes a force on moving charges as well!

The derivation of the magnitude of the force from the experimental data is
tedious. We will just learn the results, but they are exciting enough! The
magnitude of the force on a moving charge due to a constant magnetic field
is 
\begin{equation}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{B}=q\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}\times 
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}  \label{MagneticFieldForceOnCharge}
\end{equation}%
The magnitude is given by 
\begin{equation*}
F=qvB\sin \theta
\end{equation*}%
where $q$ is charge, $v$ is speed, and $B$ is the magnitude of the magnetic
field We need to carefully define $\theta .$ Since we have a cross product, $%
\theta $ is the angle between the field direction and the velocity direction.

We can solve the equation for the magnetic field force (equation \ref%
{MagneticFieldForceOnCharge}) to find the magnitude of the field 
\begin{equation*}
\frac{F}{qv\sin \theta }=B
\end{equation*}

But the strangeness has not ended. we need a direction of the force. And it
turns out that it is perpendicular to both $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}$ and 
$\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}$ as the cross product implies! We use our
favorite right hand rule to help us remember.\FRAME{dhF}{1.286in}{1.3673in}{%

of $\mathbf{\vec{B}.}$ And your fingers will point in the direction of the
force. We saw this type of right hand rule before with torque, but there is
one big difference. This really is the direction the charge will accelerate!
Note that this works for a positive charge. If the charge is negative, then
the $\ q$ in 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{B}=q\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}\times 
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}
\end{equation*}%
will be negative, and so the force will go in the other way. To keep this
straight in my own mind, I still use our right hand rule, and just remember
that if $F$ is negative, it goes the opposite way of my thumb.

\begin{Note}
Right hand rule \#2: We start with our hand pointing in the direction of $%

\begin{equation}

If I\ have a charged particle, with velocity $\mathbf{\vec{v},}$ what will
be the motion of the particle in the field? First off, we should recall that 
$\mathbf{\vec{F}}$ is in a direction perpendicular to $\mathbf{\vec{v}}$ and 
$\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}$.. Using our right hand rule we see that it
will go to the left. \FRAME{dtbpF}{2.4829in}{1.9752in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{%

direction of $F$ change. Since $v$ and $a$ are always at $90\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{b0}}%
%BeginExpansion
{{}^\circ}%
%EndExpansion
},$ the motion reminds us of circular motion! Let's see if we can find the
radius of the circular path of the charge. 
\begin{equation*}
F=qvB\sin \theta
\end{equation*}%
will be just 
\begin{equation*}
F=qvB
\end{equation*}%
because $\theta $ is always $90\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{b0}}%
%BeginExpansion
{{}^\circ}%
%EndExpansion
}.$ Then, using Newton's second law%
\begin{equation*}
F=ma=qvB
\end{equation*}%
and noting that the acceleration is center-seeking, we can write it as a
centripetal acceleration%
\begin{equation*}
a=\frac{v^{2}}{r}
\end{equation*}

Then 
\begin{equation*}
m\frac{v^{2}}{r}=qvB
\end{equation*}%
\begin{equation*}
m\frac{v}{r}=qB
\end{equation*}%
We can find the radius of the circle%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{mv}{qB}=r
\end{equation*}%
Could we find the angular speed?%
\begin{equation*}
\omega =\frac{v}{r}=\frac{qB}{m}
\end{equation*}

How about the period? We can take the total distance divided by the total
time for a revolution%
\begin{equation*}
v=\frac{2\pi r}{T}
\end{equation*}%
to find%
\begin{equation*}
T=\frac{2\pi r}{v}
\end{equation*}%
and we recognize 
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{\omega }=\frac{r}{v}
\end{equation*}%
so%
\begin{equation*}
T=\frac{2\pi }{\omega }
\end{equation*}%
so, using our angular speed we can say 
\begin{equation*}
T=\frac{2\pi m}{qB}
\end{equation*}

The angular frequency $\omega $ that we found is the frequency of a type of
particle accelerator called a cyclotron. This type of accelerator is used by
places like CERN to start the acceleration of charged particles. The same
concept is used to make the charged particles go in a circular path in the
large accelerators like the LHC at CERN.\FRAME{dtbpFU}{3.0237in}{1.7979in}{%

This device shows up on tests, especially finals, because it has both an
electric field and a magnetic field--you test two sets of knowledge at once!
So let's see how it works. Our question should be, what is the velocity of a
charged particle that travels through the field without being deflected?

$E$\textbf{-field}

We remember that the force on a positively charged particle will be 
\begin{equation*}
F_{E}=qE
\end{equation*}%
directed in the field direction so it is downward.

$B$\textbf{-Field}

Now we know that 
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{F}_{B}=q\mathbf{v}\times \mathbf{B}
\end{equation*}%
and we use our right hand rule to find that the direction will be upward
with a magnitude of 
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{B} &=&qvB\sin \theta \\
&=&qvB
\end{eqnarray*}

So there will be no deflection (no acceleration) when the forces in the $y$%
-direction balance.%
\begin{equation*}
\Sigma F_{y}=0=-F_{E}+F_{B}
\end{equation*}%
or%
\begin{equation*}
qE=qvB
\end{equation*}%
which gives 
\begin{equation*}
v=\frac{E}{B}
\end{equation*}%
as the speed that will be \textquotedblleft selected.\textquotedblright\ 

\subsection{Bainbridge Mass Spectrometer}

You may use a mass-spec some time in your careers. I have had samples
identified by mass-spectrometers several times in my industrial career. They
are very useful devices--especially when chemical identification is hard or
impossible.\FRAME{dhF}{4.011in}{2.5676in}{0in}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

'N8ESD696.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}The Bainbridge device is one type
that we can easily understand. It starts with a velocity selector which
sends charged particles at a particular speed into a region of uniform
magnetic field. The charged particles then follow curved paths on their way
to an array of detectors. When they hit the array, their spatial location is
recorded. Where they hit depends on their ration of charge to mass. From our
study of the rotational motion we found 
\begin{equation*}
r=\frac{mv}{qB_{o}}
\end{equation*}%
so the charge to mass ratio is 
\begin{equation*}
\frac{q}{m}=\frac{v}{rB_{o}}
\end{equation*}%
Since we know the initial velocity will be 
\begin{equation*}
v=\frac{E}{B}
\end{equation*}%
from the velocity selector, then 
\begin{equation*}
\frac{q}{m}=\frac{E}{rBB_{o}}
\end{equation*}

One way this is often used is to separate a sample of substance, say, carbon
to find the relative amount of each isotope. The carbon atoms will all
ionize to the same charge. Then the position at which they are detected
depends on the mass.

I used a mass-spec in my last industry project to identify large carbon
compounds and their relative concentration in complex oil leaks. This data
helped us look for possible leak detection targets so pipeline leaks could
be detected before the oil was visible to the naked eye.

\subsection{Classical Cyclotron}

We already found the period of rotation of a charged particle in a uniform
magnetic field.%
\begin{equation*}
T=\frac{2\pi m}{qB}
\end{equation*}%
Note that this does not depend on the speed of the particle! So it will have
the same travel time regardless of how fast it goes. We can use this to
accelerate particles. But we add in an electric field to do the
acceleration. The device is shown in the figure below \FRAME{dhFU}{1.8447in}{%

circling around in the magnetic field. but the device is divided into halves
(called \textquotedblleft Ds\textquotedblright ). There is a gap between the
Ds, and the electric field is created in the gap. One side at high potential
and the other at low potential. When the particle is in the gap, it
accelerates. It will gain a kinetic energy equal to the potential energy
difference across the gap%
\begin{equation*}
\Delta K=q\Delta V
\end{equation*}%
As the particle travels around the D to the other side of the, the cyclotron
switches the polarity of the potential difference. So as it passes the gap
on the other side of the cyclotron, it is again accelerated with an
additional $\Delta K=q\Delta V.$ Since $r$ does depend on the speed,%
\begin{equation*}
r=\frac{mv}{qB}
\end{equation*}%
the radius increases with each \textquotedblleft kick.\textquotedblright\
Finally the particle leaves the cyclotron with a velocity of 
\begin{equation*}
\frac{qBr_{\max }}{m}=v
\end{equation*}%
Since we often describe the velocity of particles in energy terms, the
kinetic energy of the particle%
\begin{eqnarray*}
K &=&\frac{1}{2}mv^{2} \\
&=&\frac{1}{2}m\left( \frac{qBr_{\max }}{m}\right) ^{2} \\
&=&\frac{q^{2}B^{2}r_{\max }^{2}}{2m}

Let's take a piece of material that has a current going through it. If we
place it in a magnetic field, then the charge carriers will feel a force.
Suppose it is a metal, and that the charge carriers are electrons. The force
is perpendicular to the current direction. So the electrons are accelerated
toward the top of the piece of metal as shown in the drawing. This creates a
negative charge on the top side of the metal piece. Then the bottom side
will be positively charged relative to the top. With separated charge like
this, we think of a capacitor and the electric field created by such a
separation of charges. There will be a field in the conductor with a
potential difference between the top and bottom of the conductor. We call
this potential difference%
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V_{H}
\end{equation*}%
the Hall potential after the man who first observed it.

Now if the charge carriers were positive, we would still build up a
potential, but it would be in the opposite polarity. We wish to find this
hall potential. The electric field of the charges will try to push them back
down as more charge builds up. So at some point the upward force due to the
magnetic field on the electrons will be balanced by the built up electric
field. At that point%
\begin{equation*}
\Sigma F_{y}=0=F_{B}-F_{E}
\end{equation*}%
so 
\begin{equation*}
qv_{d}B=qE_{H}
\end{equation*}%
where $E_{H}$ is the field due to the separation of charges.

So 
\begin{equation*}
E_{H}=v_{d}B
\end{equation*}%
The potential is nearly equal to 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V\approx E_{H}d
\end{equation*}%
where $d$ is the top-to-bottom distance of the conductor , so 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V\approx v_{d}Bd
\end{equation*}%
Since we know 
\begin{equation*}
I=nqAv_{d}
\end{equation*}%
then 
\begin{equation*}
v_{d}=\frac{I}{nqA}
\end{equation*}%
and the area $A$ is 
\begin{equation*}
A=td
\end{equation*}%
where $t$ is the thickness of the conductor, then 
\begin{equation*}
v_{d}=\frac{I}{nqtd}
\end{equation*}%
and%
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V\approx \frac{IB}{nqt}
\end{equation*}%
You may find this expressed in terms of the Hall coefficient%
\begin{equation*}
R_{H}=\frac{1}{nq}
\end{equation*}%
so%
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V\approx R_{H}\frac{IB}{t}
\end{equation*}%
To do a good job of finding $R_{H}$ for metals and semiconductors, you have
to go beyond classical theory. But if we know $B,$ $I,$ $t,$ and $\Delta V,$
which can all be measured, then we can find $R_{H}.$ Once this is done, we
can place the Hall probe in different magnetic fields to find their
strength. One way to do this is to control $I$ and measure $\Delta V,$ so%
\begin{equation*}
B\approx \frac{t}{R_{H}I}\Delta V
\end{equation*}

If there is a force on a single moving charge due to a magnetic field, then
there must be a force on lots of moving charges! We call lots of moving
charges an electric current%
\begin{equation*}
I=\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}
\end{equation*}%
For charges in a wire, we know that the charges move along the wire with a
velocity $v_{d}.$ We would expect the total force on all the charges to be
the sum of all the forces on the individual charges.%
\begin{equation*}
F_{I}=\dsum\limits_{i}F_{q_{i}}=\dsum\limits_{i}q_{i}vB\sin \theta
\end{equation*}%
but, since in our wire all the charge carriers are the same, this is just 
\begin{equation*}
F_{I}=Nq_{i}v_{d}B\sin \theta
\end{equation*}%
where here $N$ is the number of charge carriers in the part of the wire that
is experiencing the field. We used a charge density $n$ before. Let's use it
again to make an expression for $N$%
\begin{equation*}
N=nV=nAL
\end{equation*}%
where $A$ is the cross sectional area of the wire and $L$ is the length of
the wire. So%
\begin{equation*}
F_{I}=nALq_{i}v_{d}B\sin \theta
\end{equation*}%
Now let's think back to our definition of current. We know that 
\begin{equation*}
I=nq_{i}v_{d}A
\end{equation*}%
so our force on the current carrying wire is%
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{I} &=&\left( nq_{i}v_{d}A\right) LB\sin \theta \\
&=&ILB\sin \theta
\end{eqnarray*}
Remember that $\theta $ is the angle between the field direction and the
velocity. In this case $I$ is in the direction of the velocity (we still
assume positive charge carriers, even though we know they are electrons). So 
$\theta $ is the angle between the field direction and the direction of the
current. We can write this as a cross product%
\begin{equation}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{I}=I\overrightarrow{\mathbf{L}}\mathbf{\times }%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}
\end{equation}%
where $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{L}}$ is in the current direction.

B_{12.}$%
\begin{equation*}
F_{12}=I_{1}LB_{12}

and using our expression for $B_{12}$%
\begin{eqnarray}
F_{12} &=&I_{1}L\frac{\mu _{o}I_{2}}{2\pi d}  \notag \\

Remember that in PH121 or Statics and Dynamics we defined angular
displacement%
\begin{equation}
\Delta \theta =\theta _{f}-\theta _{i}
\end{equation}%
and this told us how far in angle we had traveled from a starting point $%
\theta _{i}.$

We also defined the angular velocity%
\begin{equation}
\omega =\frac{\Delta \theta }{\Delta t}
\end{equation}%
which told us how fast an object was spinning in radians per second. The
direction of this angular velocity we found using a right hand rule.

We also defined an angular acceleration%
\begin{equation}
\alpha =\frac{\Delta \omega }{\Delta t}
\end{equation}%
and we used angular acceleration in combination with a moment of inertia to
express a rotational form of Newton's second law%
\begin{equation}
\sum \tau =I\alpha
\end{equation}%
where $\tau $ is a torque. We found torque with the expression 
\begin{equation}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{\tau }}=\overrightarrow{\mathbf{r}}\times 
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}
\end{equation}%
We wish to apply these ideas to our new force on wires due to magnetism.

Let's take a specific example. I want to use a current loop. This is just
the simple loop of current we have seen before.\FRAME{dtbpF}{2.009in}{%

I drew the current loop as a rectangle on purpose, I want to look at the
force on the current for each part of the loop. Each side of our loop is a
straight wire segment. Remember that the magnitude of the force on a wire is
given by 
\begin{equation*}
F_{I}=ILB\sin \theta
\end{equation*}%
where $\theta $ is the angle between $I$ and $B$ so if $\theta =0$ or if $%
\theta =\pi \unit{rad}$, then $\sin \theta $ will be zero. The magnitude of
the force will then be zero. So the top and bottom parts of the loop will
not experience a force. The sides will, though, and since for $\theta =\frac{%
\pi }{2}$ or $\theta =-\frac{\pi }{2}$ ($\theta =-\frac{\pi }{2}$ is the
same as $\theta =\frac{3\pi }{2}$) then $\sin \theta =1$ and the force will
be a maximum.%
\begin{equation*}
F_{I}=IbB
\end{equation*}%
on each side wire segment. But we need to consider direction. The force will
be perpendicular to both $I$ and $B.$ We use our right hand rule. Fingers in
the direction of $I,$ curl to the direction of $B.$ We see the force is out
of the figure for the left hand side and into the figure for the right hand
side. The next figure is a bottom-up view.

\FRAME{dhF}{1.6319in}{2.0911in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language
"Scientific Word";type "GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio TRUE;display

"1";cropright "1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename
'N8ESD79C.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}Clearly the loop will want to
turn! This looks like a nice problem for us to describe with a torque. We
have a force acting at a distance from a pivot. We have a torque%
\begin{equation*}
\tau =rF\sin \psi
\end{equation*}%
We have already used $\theta ,$ and our torque angle is the angle between $r$
and $F$, so we needed a new greek letter. I\ have used $\psi $\footnote{%
which is a \emph{psi}}. Then $\psi $ is the angle between $r$ and $F.$

Let's fill in the details of our total torque. Remember we have two torques,
one for the left hand side, and one for the right and side. Their magnitudes
are the same, and the directions we need to get from yet another right hand
rule. Both are in the same direction so 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\tau &=&\frac{a}{2}F_{I}\sin \left( \psi \right) +\frac{a}{2}\left(
F_{I}\right) \sin \left( \psi \right) \\
&=&aF_{I}\sin \left( \psi \right)
\end{eqnarray*}%
Putting in the force magnitude gives%
\begin{equation*}
\tau =a\left( IbB\right) \sin \psi
\end{equation*}%
and rearranging lets us see%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\tau &=&\left( ab\right) IB\sin \psi \\
&=&\left( A\right) IB\sin \psi
\end{eqnarray*}%
where $A=ab$ is the area of our loop. Of course we can write this as%
\begin{equation}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{\tau }}\mathbf{=}I\overrightarrow{\mathbf{A}}\times 
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}
\end{equation}%
The torque is the cross product of the area vector and the magnetic field
multiplied by the current.

We did this for a square loop. It turns out that it works for any loop shape.

When things rotate, we expect to use moments. We defined a magnetic dipole
moment for a current loop. Now we can see why it is useful. The magnetic
moment tells us about how much torque we will get for a particular current
loop.%
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{\mu }}_{d}=I\overrightarrow{\mathbf{A}}
\end{equation*}%
using this we have%
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{\tau }}\mathbf{=}\overrightarrow{\mathbf{\mu }}%
_{d}\times \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}
\end{equation*}

We could envision our loop as a single circle of wire connected to a
battery. But we could just as easily double up the wire. If we do this, what
is our torque? Well we would have twice the force, because we now have twice
the current (the current goes trough both turns of the wire). So now we have 
\begin{equation*}
\tau =2\left( A\right) IB\sin \psi
\end{equation*}%
But why stop there? We could make three loops all together.%
\begin{equation*}
\tau =3\left( A\right) IB\sin \psi
\end{equation*}%
or many more, say $N$ loops,%
\begin{equation*}
\tau =NAIB\sin \psi
\end{equation*}

Thinking of our magnetic dipole moment, we see that 
\begin{equation*}
\tau =N\mu _{d}B\sin \psi
\end{equation*}%
for a coil. We could combine the effects of all the loops into one magnetic
moment that represents the coil. 
\begin{equation}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{\mu }}=N\overrightarrow{\mathbf{A}}I
\end{equation}%
then 
\begin{equation*}
\tau =\mu B\sin \psi
\end{equation*}%
or in cross product form%
\begin{equation}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{\tau }}\mathbf{=}\overrightarrow{\mathbf{\mu }}%
\times \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}
\end{equation}%
Using this total magnetic moment, we can more easily do problems with coils
in magnetic fields.

For example, we found that there was a potential energy associated with
spinning dipoles, for a spinning current loop we also expect a potential
energy. We have a simple formula for this potential energy in terms of the
magnetic moment.

\begin{equation}
U=-\overrightarrow{\mathbf{\mu }}\cdot \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}
\end{equation}

typical design of a galvanometer. It has a coil of wire (shown looking at
the side of the coil) and a spring. The coil is placed between the ends of a
magnet. When there is a current in the wire, there will be a torque on the
coil that will compress the spring. The amount of torque depends on the
current. As the current increases, the spring is more compressed. A marker
(large needle) is attached to the apparatus. As the spring is compressed,
the indicator moves across the scale. Since this movement is proportional to
the current, a galvanometer can easily measure current.

With our new understanding of torque on a current loop, we should be able to
see how an electric motor works. A current loop is placed in between two
magnets to form a magnetic field. The loop will turn because of the torque
due to the $B$-field. But we have to get clever. What happens when the loop
turns half way around so the current is now going the opposite way?\FRAME{%

direction every time the loop turns half way.\FRAME{dhF}{2.3817in}{1.9346in}{%

We all would like to know how magnets work. Can a permanent magnet have
something to do with current loops?\FRAME{dhF}{3.4696in}{1.6224in}{0pt}{}{}{%

2.3315in;cropleft "0";croptop "1";cropright "1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename
'N8ESD89I.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}Well, lets look at the field due
to a current loop. It looks a lot like the field due to a magnet. Could
there be current loops inside a bar magnet? The answer is well, sort of...
We have electrons that sort of travel around the atom. Suppose the electrons
orbit like planets. Then there would be a current as they travel. For one
electron the current would be%
\begin{equation*}
I=\frac{q_{e}}{T}
\end{equation*}%
where $T$ is the period of rotation. It is an amount of charge per unit
time. We can write this as 
\begin{equation*}
I=q_{e}\frac{\omega }{2\pi }
\end{equation*}%
and recalling 
\begin{equation*}
v_{t}=\omega r
\end{equation*}%
then%
\begin{equation*}
I=q_{e}\frac{v_{t}}{2\pi r}
\end{equation*}%
We can find a magnetic moment (a good review of what we have learned!) 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mu &=&NIA=\left( 1\right) IA \\
&=&q_{e}\frac{v_{t}}{2\pi r}\left( \pi r^{2}\right) \\
&=&\frac{q_{e}v_{t}r}{2}
\end{eqnarray*}%
Physicists often write this in terms of angular momentum. Just to review,
angular momentum is given by%
\begin{equation*}
L=I_{m}\omega
\end{equation*}%
where $I_{m}$ is the moment of inertia. Then 
\begin{eqnarray*}
L &=&I_{m}\omega \\
&=&\left( mr^{2}\right) \left( \frac{v_{t}}{r}\right) \\
&=&mrv_{t}
\end{eqnarray*}%
so the magnetic moment of the orbiting electron would be%
\begin{equation}
\mu =\frac{q_{e}L}{2m}
\end{equation}%
which gives us a magnetic moment related to the angular momentum of the
electron.

All of this works well for Hydrogen. We find that individual hydrogen atoms
do act like small magnets. But if the hydrogen is in a compound, it is more
complicated because we then have many electrons and they are
\textquotedblleft orbiting\textquotedblright\ in different directions. It is
even true that most atoms have many electrons, and within the atom these
electrons fly around in all different directions. The magnetic field due to
one electron in the atom cancels out the magnetic field due to another, so
there is no net magnetic field. So in general there is no net magnetic
field. Even for Hydrogen in a compound the overall magnetic moment of the
compound tends to cancel out.

Further, we know that electrons do not travel like planets in circular
orbits. So our model for magnetism is not really correct yet. To understand
the current model of electron orbitals takes some quantum mechanics (and a
few more years of physics). But we can understand a little, because quantum
mechanics does tell us that the electrons have angular momentum. The big
difference is that the angular momentum is \emph{quantized} meaning it can
have only certain values (think of the quantized modes of an oscillating
string). The smallest magnetic moment for an electron turns out to be 
\begin{equation}
\mu =\sqrt{2}\frac{q_{e}}{2m_{e}}\hslash
\end{equation}%
where 
\begin{equation*}
\hslash =\frac{h}{2\pi }=1.05\times 10^{-34}\unit{J}\unit{s}
\end{equation*}%
is pronounced \textquotedblleft h-bar\textquotedblright\ and is a constant.
We encountered Planck's constant $h$ before ($h=6.63\times 10^{-34}\unit{J}%
\unit{s}$). This is just Planck's constant divided by $2\pi .$ So it would
seem that with only certain values being available the magnetic moments
might be more likely to line up.

But it turns out that even in quantum mechanics, the magnetic moments of the
electrons due to their orbits cancel each other out most of the time.

But there is another contribution to the magnetic moment, this time from the
electron, itself. The electron has an amount of angular momentum. It is as
though it spins on an axis. This spin angular momentum is also quantized. It
can take values of%
\begin{equation}
S=\pm \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\hslash
\end{equation}%
My mental picture of this is a charged ball spinning on an axis. \FRAME{dhF}{%

is 
\begin{equation}
\mu _{s}=\frac{q_{e}\hslash }{2m_{e}}
\end{equation}

This means that electrons, themselves are little magnets. Where does this
magnetic moment come from? Well it is \emph{as though} the electron is
constantly spinning. It is not really, but this is a semi-classical mental
model that we can use to envision the source of the electron's magnetic
field. The \textquotedblleft spinning\textquotedblright\ electron is
charged, so the electron acts like a miniscule current loop. The electron,
itself is a source of the magnetic field for permanent magnets.

The spin magnetic moment was given the strange name \emph{Bohr magneton} in
honor of Niels Bohr. If there are many electrons in the atom, there will be
many contributions to the total atomic magnetic moment. The nucleus also has
a magnetic moment (a detail we will not discuss) and there are other details
like electron spin states pairing up. But those are topics for PH279 and our
senior quantum mechanics class. But it turns out that this spin magnetic
moment is the major cause that produces permanent magnetism. We don't want
to wade though a senior level physics class now (well, you probably don't
anyway) so we need a more macroscopic description of magnetism. But
fundamentally, if we can get the electrons spins in a material to line up,
we will have a magnet.

Because of the spin magnetic moment, we can see some hope for how a
permanent might work. But these spin magnetic moments are also mostly
randomly arranged. So again, most atoms won't have an overall magnetic
moment. But some atoms do have a slight net field. They have an odd number
of electrons. So the last electron can have an unbalanced magnetic moment.
That atom would act as a magnet

Still, this does not produce much of an effect, because neighboring atoms
all are oriented differently. So neighboring atoms cancel each other out. In
a few materials, though, the atoms within small volumes will align their
magnetic moments. These little domains form small magnets. But still the
overall effect is very small because the domains are all oriented in
different directions.\FRAME{dhF}{1.3837in}{1.3396in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{%

ones that can are called ferromagnetic. Iron is one material. We can make
the domains align, but the alignment decays quickly. That is why iron
objects stick to a magnet, but don't stick to each other when they are taken
away from the magnet. But if we can force the domains to stay in one
direction, say, by heating the ferromagnetic metal in a magnetic field and
letting it cool and form crystals, then we can make a magnet that will last
longer. The magnetic moments will get stuck all pointing about the same
direction as the ferromagnetic metal cools. Some materials like Cobalt form
very long lasting permanent magnets.

\subsection{Magnetization vector}

We now know that each atom of a substance may have a magnetic moment. For a
block of the material, it is useful to think of the magnetic moment per unit
volume. We will call this $\mathbf{M.}$ It must be a vector, so that if
there is an overall magnetic moment, we have a magnet! Let's see how to use
this new quantity.

Suppose I have a current carrying wire that produces a field $\mathbf{B}%
_{o}. $ But I also have a material where $\mathbf{M}$ is not zero. Then
there must be a a field due to the magnetic material $\mathbf{B}_{m}.$ So
the total field will be%
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{B}=\mathbf{B}_{o}+\mathbf{B}_{m}
\end{equation}%
and all we have to do is determine the relationship between $\mathbf{B}_{m}$
and $\mathbf{M.}$

\subsection{Solenoid approximation}

Lets look at two atoms, We will model them as little current loops, since
they have magnetic moments.

solenoid.

\begin{eqnarray*}

\end{eqnarray*}%
I didn't cancel the $A$s because I want to recognize the numerator as the
magnetic moment 
\begin{equation*}
\mu =NIA
\end{equation*}%
so 
\begin{equation*}
B_{m}=\mu _{o}\frac{\mu }{\ell A}
\end{equation*}%
but note that $\ell A$ is just the volume of the piece of magnetic material,
so 
\begin{equation*}
B_{m}=\mu _{o}\frac{\mu }{V}
\end{equation*}%
which is gives us our new quantity, the magnetization vector%
\begin{equation}
M=\frac{\mu }{V}
\end{equation}%
well, this is the magnitude, anyway, so 
\begin{equation}
B_{m}=\mu _{o}M
\end{equation}%
and of course the directions must be the same, since $\mu _{o}$ is just a
scalar constant%
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{B}_{m}=\mu _{o}\mathbf{M}
\end{equation}

So the total field is given by

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{B}=\mathbf{B}_{o}+\mu _{o}\mathbf{M}

Sometimes we physicists just can't let things alone. So when we arrived at
the equation%
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{B}=\mathbf{B}_{o}+\mu _{o}\mathbf{M}
\end{equation}%
someone wanted to define a new term%
\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathbf{B}_{o}}{\mu _{o}}
\end{equation}%
so we could write the equation%
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{B}=\mu _{o}\left( \frac{\mathbf{B}_{o}}{\mu _{o}}+\mathbf{M}\right)
\end{equation}%
This new term is given an unfortunate name. The \emph{magnetic field strength%
}. \textbf{It is not the magnitude of the magnetic field}, but is the
magnitude divided by the constant $\mu _{o}.$ It has it's own symbol, $%
\mathbf{H}.$ So you may write our total field equation as%
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{B}=\mu _{o}\left( \mathbf{H}+\mathbf{M}\right)
\end{equation}

You might find this change unnecessary and confusing (I do) but it is
tradition to use this notation, and is not bad once you get used to it.

\subsection{Macroscopic properties of magnetic materials}

We want a way to describe how \textquotedblleft magnetic\textquotedblright\
different substances are without doing quantum mechanics. This will allow us
to classify materials, and choose the proper material for whatever
experiment or device we are designing.

For many substances we find that the magnetization vector is proportional to
the field strength (which is why field strength hangs around in usage)%
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{M}=\chi \mathbf{H}
\end{equation}

For many materials, this nice linear relationship applies, and we can look
up the constant of proportionality in a table. The name of the constant $%
\chi $ is the \emph{magnetic susceptibility}.

If $\chi $ is positive ($M$ is in the same direction as $H)$, we call the
material \emph{paramagnetic}.

If $\chi $ is negative ($M$ is in the opposite direction as $H)$, we call
the material \emph{diamagnetic}.

Using this new notation, our total field becomes%
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{B}=\mu _{o}\left( \mathbf{H}+\mathbf{M}\right)
\end{equation*}%
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{B}=\mu _{o}\left( \mathbf{H}+\chi \mathbf{H}\right)
\end{equation*}%
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{B}=\mu _{o}\left( 1+\chi \right) \mathbf{H}
\end{equation}%
The quantity $\mu _{o}\left( 1+\chi \right) $ is also given a name, 
\begin{equation}
\mu _{m}=\mu _{o}\left( 1+\chi \right)
\end{equation}%
it is called the magnetic permeability. Now you see why $\mu _{o}$ is called
the permeability of free space! (the name was not so random after all!). If $%
\chi =0$ then 
\begin{equation}
\mu _{m}=\mu _{o}
\end{equation}%
and this is the case for free space. We can write definitions of
paramagnetism and diamagnetism in terms of the permeability.

\begin{equation*}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
Paramagnetic & $\mu _{m}>\mu _{o}$ \\ 
Diamagnetic & $\mu _{m}<\mu _{o}$ \\ 
Free Space & $\mu _{m}=\mu _{o}$%
\end{tabular}%
\end{equation*}

For paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials, $\mu _{m}$ is usually not too
different from $\mu _{o}$ but for ferromagnetic materials $\mu _{m}$ is much
larger than $\mu _{o}.$

Note that we have not included ferromagnetic substances in this discussion.
That is because 
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{M}=\chi \mathbf{H}
\end{equation*}%
is not true for ferromagnetic materials.

But why is ferromagnetism different? To try to understand, let's take a iron
toroid and wrap it with a coil as shown. \FRAME{dtbpF}{2.2978in}{2.4647in}{%

'N8ESD99Q.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}We have a magnetic field meter
that measures the field inside the windings of the coil. When we throw the
switch, the coil produces a magnetic field. The field will produce a
magnetization vector in the iron toroid and, therefore, a field strength. We
can plot the applied magnetic field vs. the field strength to see how much
effect the applied field has on the magnetic properties of the iron toroid.
We won't do this mathematically, but the result is shown in the figure.%
\FRAME{dtbpF}{2.8228in}{2.5875in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

'N8ESD99R.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}As we throw the switch, we go
from no alignment of the domains so zero $M$ and therefore zero induced
field in the iron toroid to a value that represents the almost complete
alignment of the magnetic moments of each atom of the iron. This is point $%
a. $ It may take a bit of current, but in theory we can always do this. All
the domains are aligned and $M$ is maximum.

Now we reduce the current from our battery, and we find that the field due
to the aligned domains drops as expected, but not along the same path that
we started on! We go from $a$ to $b$ as the current decreases. At point $b$
there is no current, but we still have a magnetic field in the toroid!

We can even keep going and reverse the field by changing the polarity of our
power supply contacts. Since we still have some field in the toroid, it
actually takes some reverse current to overcome the residual field. But if
we apply enough reverse current, then we get alignment in the other
direction. Almost complete alignment is at point $d.$ If we again reduce the
current and find that--once again--it does not retrace the same path!

Each time we align the domains with our applied external field from the
coil, the domains in the iron toroid seem to want to stay aligned. Most do
lose alignment, but some stay put. We have created a weak permanent magnet
by placing our ferromagnetic material in a strong external magnetic field.

This strangely shaped curve is the \emph{magnetization curve} for the
material. The fact that the path is a strange loop instead of always
following the same path is called \emph{magnetic hysteresis}. We can see now
that the external field (represented by the current $I,$ since $%
B_{extrnal}\varpropto I$) and magnetization don't behave in a simple
relationship like they did for diamagnetic or permanganic materials.

The thickness of the area traced by the hysteresis curve depends on the
material. It also represents the energy required to take the material
through the hysteresis cycle.

If we add enough thermal energy, it is hard to keep the atomic dipole
moments aligned. The next figure shows this effect.

\FRAME{dhF}{1.4659in}{1.446in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

'N8ESD99S.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}At a temperature called the Curie
temperature, the material no longer acts ferromagnetic. It becomes simply
paramagnetic. So if we heat up a permanent magnet, we expect it to lose it's
alignment and therefore to stop being a magnet. This is what happens to
ferromagnetic materials when they are heated due to volcanism. The domains
are destroyed and all the atoms lose alignment. Whey the material cools, the
Earth's magnetic field acts as an external field and some of the domains
will be aligned with this field. This is how we know that the Earth's
magnetic field switches polarity. We can see which way the magnetization
vector points in the cooled lava deposits from places like the Mid-Atlantic
Trench.

This is also how magnetic tapes and disks work.

\subsection{Paramagnetism}

So what is paramagnetism? It comes from the material having a small natural
magnetic susceptibility.%
\begin{equation}
0<\chi \ll 1
\end{equation}%
So in the presence of an external magnetic field, you can force the little
magnetic moments to line up. You are competing with thermal motion as we saw
in ferromagnetism, so the effect is usually weak. A rule of thumb for
paramagnetism is that 
\begin{equation}
M=C\frac{B_{o}}{T}
\end{equation}%
where $C$ contains the particular material properties of the substance you
are investigating (another thing to look up in tables in books), $B_{o}$ the
applied field, and $T$ is the temperature. In other words, if it is cool
enough, a paramagnetic material becomes a magnet in the presence of an
external magnetic field. This is a little like polarization of neutral
insulators in the presence of an electric field. For paramagnetic materials,
the induced magnetic field is in the same direction as the external field.

Some examples of paramagnetic materials and their susceptibilities are given
below%
\begin{equation*}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
Material & Susceptibility \\ 
Tungsten & $6.8\times 10^{-5}$ \\ 
Aluminium & $2.2\times 10^{-5}$ \\ 
Sodium & $0.72\times 10^{-5}$%
\end{tabular}%
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Diamagnetism.}

This is fundamentally quite different from paramagnetism. It comes from the
material having paired electrons that orbit the atom (classical model). The
magnetic moments of the electrons will have equal magnitudes, but opposite
directions (a little bit of quantum mechanics to go with our classical
model). When the external field is applied, one electron's orbit is enhanced
by the field, and the other is diminished (think $q\mathbf{v}\times B$). So
there will be a net magnetic moment. If you think about this for a while,
you will realize that the new net magnetic moment is in the opposite
direction of the applied external field! So diamagnetism will always repel.

There is always some diamagnetism in all mater. We can enhance the effect
using a superconductor. The diamagnetism of the superconductor repeals the
external field entirely! Why does this happen only for superconductors?
Well, that will take more theory to discover (a great topic for our junior
level electrodynamics class). But the phenomena is called the Meissner
effect.

\section{Back to the Earth}

So now we can see that the Earth is a magnet and we know how magnets are
formed. But wait, why is the Earth a magnet? The real answer is that we
don't know. But we believe that again it is because of current loops. We
believe there is a current of ionized Nickel and Iron in near the center of
the Earth. So the flow of these charged liquid metals will create a magnetic
field. This is a vary large current loop! The evidence for this is that
magnetic field seems proportional to the spin rate of the planet. But this
is an area of active research.

It is curious that the magnetic pole and the geographic pole are not in the
same place. The magnetic pole also moves around like a precession. Then,
every couple of hundred thousand years, the polarity of the Earth's field
switches altogether!

There is still plenty of good research to do in this area.

The location of the magnetic pole explains the declination adjustment you
have to use when using a compass. What you are really doing is accounting
for the difference in pole location.

\section{Induced currents}

We spend most of the last two lectures building a relationship between
moving charge (current) and magnetic fields.%

But suppose we have moving magnetic fields. Could a moving magnetic field
make a current?

If we think of relative motion, it seems like it should. After all, how do
we know that it is the charge that is moving and not a moving $B$-field. In
fact, moving $B$-fields \emph{do} cause a current. We say that a moving or
changing magnetic field \emph{induces} a current.

Notice that in our movie, the current does not stay constant. As the magnet
moves, we get a spike in current. But it drops back down to zero. When the
magnet is taken away, again we get a spike in current (now the other
direction). But again it dies back down. The current seems to exist only as
the field changes, and there is more current where the field is changing
fastest

Faraday discovered this effect. He described it as an \emph{induced emf}. An
emf is something that \textquotedblleft pumps\textquotedblright\ the charges
in the wire. It takes them from a lower to a higher potential so they can
form a current. The changing magnetic field must be \textquotedblleft
pumping\textquotedblright\ the charges as it changes!

What is really going on here? Think for a minute what must be happening.%

of potential energy. When a current flows from the $+$ end of the battery to
the $-$ end. there must be an electric field acting on the charge in the
wire! That is what creates the electric potential. So, then, does a moving
magnetic field create an electric field?

The answer is yes! We say that an electric field is \emph{induced} by a
moving magnetic field. This is really the same as saying that there is an
induced emf for our current loop.

magnet.

To be able to calculate how much current flows, we will need to investigate
changing magnetic fields. We will do this next lecture with our concept of
flux.

\section{Motional emf}

Last lecture, we studied Faraday's experiment. He created a magnetic field,
and then used that magnetic field to make a current. But currents are caused
by electric fields! Did Faraday's magnetic field create an electric field?

To investigate Faraday's result, let's see if we can find a way to use
charge motion and a magnetic field to make an electric field. Let's take a
bar of metal and move it in a magnetic field. The bar has free charges in it
(electrons). We have given them a velocity. So we expect a magnetic force 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{B}=q\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}\times 
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}
\end{equation*}%
The free charges will accelerate together, but the positive stationary
charges can't move. We have found another way to separate charge. We know
that separated charge creates a potential difference. We often call this
induced potential difference the \emph{motional emf} because it is created
by moving our apparatus.

Let's take an example to see how it works. \FRAME{dhF}{2.9776in}{2.3999in}{%
0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language "Scientific Word";type
"GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio TRUE;display "USEDEF";valid_file "T";width

'N8ESD99V.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}For this example, let's look at a
piece of wire moving in a constant field. To make the math easy, let's move
the wire with a velocity perpendicular to the $B$-field.

As the figure shows, the electrons will feel a force. Using our right hand
rule, we get an upward force for positive charge carriers, but we know the
electrons are negative charge carriers, so the force is downward. We find
that the magnitude of the force is 
\begin{equation*}
F_{B}=qvB
\end{equation*}

The electrons will bunch up at the bottom of the piece of wire, until their
electric force of repulsion forces them to stop. That force is 
\begin{equation*}
F_{E}=qE
\end{equation*}%
By separating the charges along the wire, we now have and $E$-field. We can
solve for $E$ when we have reached equilibrium.%
\begin{equation*}
\Sigma F=0=-F_{B}+F_{E}
\end{equation*}%
or%
\begin{equation*}
qE=qvB
\end{equation*}%
which tells us%
\begin{equation}
E=vB
\end{equation}%
Now, we know that electric fields cause potential differences. The $E$-field
in the wire will be nearly uniform. Then it looks much like a capacitor with
separated charges. The potential difference will be 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta V &=&\int \overrightarrow{E}\cdot d\overrightarrow{s} \\
&\approx &EL
\end{eqnarray*}%
where $L$ is the length of our wire. So 
\begin{equation}
\Delta V\approx vBL
\end{equation}

This is like a battery. The magnetic field is \textquotedblleft
pumping\textquotedblright\ charge. If we connected the two ends somehow with
a wire that is not moving, a current will flow (that is tricky to actually
do!).%

Let's take another example. We wish to make a bar of metal move in a $B$%
-field. To make the rest of the circuit, we allow the bar to slide along two
wires as shown. We will call the two wires \textquotedblleft
rails\textquotedblright\ since they look a little like railroad rails. Then
we have a connection between our moving piece of metal, and the rest of the
circuit. What we have is very like the circuit on the right hand side of the
last figure.

We will have to apply a force $F_{pull}$ to move the bar. This is because
there is another force, marked as $F_{resistive}$ in the figure. This force
is one we know, but might not recognize unless we think about it. We now
have a current flowing through a wire, and the wire is in a magnetic field.
So there will be a force%
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{resistive} &=&I\overrightarrow{L}\times \overrightarrow{B} \\
&=&ILB\sin \theta \\
&=&ILB
\end{eqnarray*}%
pushing to the left. This force resists our pull.

From Ohm's law, the current in the wire will be 
\begin{eqnarray*}
I &=&\frac{\Delta V}{R} \\
&=&\frac{vBL}{R}
\end{eqnarray*}%
so the force is 
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{resistive} &=&\left( \frac{vBL}{R}\right) LB \\
&=&\frac{vB^{2}L^{2}}{R}
\end{eqnarray*}%
Thus we have to push with an equal force 
\begin{equation*}
F_{push}=F_{resistive}
\end{equation*}%
to keep the bar moving along the rails. If $F_{push}<F_{resistive}$ then the
bar will have an acceleration, and it will be in the opposite direction from
the velocity, so the bar will slow down.

We found that the electric flux was very useful. We used Gauss' law to find
fields using the idea of electric flux. It turns out that this magnetic flux
is also a very useful idea. There is a difference, though. With electric
fluxes, we had imaginary areas that the field penetrated. Often when we
measure magnetic flux, we actually have something at the location of our
area. We generally want to know the flux through a wire loop.

Just like with electric flux, we expect the flux to be proportional to the
number of field lines that pass through the area.

\subsection{Non uniform magnetic fields}

So far in this lecture we have only drawn uniform magnetic fields and
considered their flux. But we can easily imagine a non-uniform field. We
tackled non-uniform electric field fluxes. We should take on non-uniform
magnetic field fluxes as well. Suppose we have the situation shown in the
following figure.\FRAME{dhF}{1.8576in}{1.4901in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special%

'N8ESDBA4.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}We have a loop of wire, and the
loop is in a flux that changes from left to right.

To find the flux through such a loop of wire, we can envision a small
element of area, $d\overrightarrow{A}$ as shown. The flux through this area
element is 
\begin{equation*}
d\Phi _{B}=\overrightarrow{B}\cdot d\overrightarrow{A}
\end{equation*}%
We can integrate this to find the total flux%
\begin{equation}
\Phi _{B}=\int_{A}\overrightarrow{B}\cdot d\overrightarrow{A}
\end{equation}

again.\FRAME{dhF}{4.1234in}{3.237in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

The flux through the green rectangular area is almost constant. The little
area is given by%
\begin{equation*}

90\unit{%

}.$ Then 
\begin{equation*}
d\Phi _{B}=\frac{\mu _{o}I}{2\pi r}bdr\left( 1\right)
\end{equation*}%

\begin{eqnarray*}
\Phi _{B} &=&\int_{r_{o}}^{r=a}\int_{o}^{b}\frac{\mu _{o}I}{2\pi r}dydr \\
&=&\frac{\mu _{o}Ib}{2\pi }\int_{r_{o}}^{r_{o}+a}\frac{1}{r}dr \\
&=&\frac{\mu _{o}Ib}{2\pi }\left( \ln \left( r_{o}+a\right) -\ln \left(
r_{o}\right) \right) \\
&=&\frac{\mu _{o}Ib}{2\pi }\ln \left( \frac{r_{o}+a}{r_{o}}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

We can even put in some numbers for this case. Suppose our loop has a height
of $b=0.05\unit{m}$ and a width of $a=0.01\unit{m}$ and that it is a
distance $r_{o}=a$ away from the current carrying wire and that the current
is $I=0.5\unit{A}$. Then 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Phi _{B} &=&\frac{\left( 4\pi \times 10^{-7}\frac{\unit{T}\unit{m}}{\unit{A}%
}\right) \left( 0.5\unit{A}\right) \left( 0.05\unit{m}\right) }{2\pi }\ln
\left( \frac{0.01\unit{m}+0.01\unit{m}}{0.01\unit{m}}\right) \\
&=&3.\,\allowbreak 465\,7\times 10^{-9}\unit{Wb}
\end{eqnarray*}%
the unit of magnetic flux is called the weber and it is given by : 
\begin{equation*}
\unit{Wb}=\unit{T}\unit{m}^{2}=\frac{\unit{m}^{2}}{\unit{A}}\frac{\unit{kg}}{%
\unit{s}^{2}}
\end{equation*}

We know now how to calculate magnetic flux, but you should expect that we
can do something with this flux to simplify problems. And your expectation
would be right. We used electric flux in Gauss' law. We will use magnetic
flux to find the induced emf. An induced emf can create a current, and this
is the basic idea behind a generator. The law that governs this relationship
between induced emf and magnetic flux is called \emph{Faraday's law} after
the scientist that discovered it. We will study this law in our next lecture.

u-shaped conductor and a magnetic field. The moving bar makes the current
flow. But now we know another way to express this. We can see that there is
a magnetic flux through the loop consisting of the u-shaped conductor and
the sliding bar. This flux going through the loop is changing. The area is
getting larger, so the amount of field going through the loop is increasing.
We can say the induced current is due to the changing loop area in the
presence of the magnetic field, or a changing magnetic flux.

An important thing we learned is that the moving bar feels a resistive force
due to the current and magnetic field. It seems like the magnetic field and
current are resisting any change in our set up. We will see in this lecture
that this is true in general.

It turns out that there is more than one way to cause an induced current.
Any change in the magnetic flux is found to make a current flow. Remember in
class we found that putting a magnet into or pulling the magnet out of a
coil makes a current. In this case, the strength of the magnetic field
changes, so the flux changes. Really any change in magnetic flux makes a
current flow.

\section{Fundamental Concepts in the Lecture}

\begin{itemize}
\item Changing magnetic flux makes an electric field--which has an
associated potential difference or emf.

\item The current caused by the induced emf travels in the direction that
creates a magnetic field with flux opposing the change in the original flux
through the circuit.

\item The emf (potential difference) generated by a changing magnetic field
is given by $\mathcal{E}=-N\frac{\Delta \Phi _{B}}{\Delta t}$
\end{itemize}

\section{Lenz}

What we are saying is that if we change the magnetic flux through a loop, we
will get a current. The direction of current flow is not obvious. Lenz
experimentally determined which way it will go. Here is his rule

\begin{Note}
The current caused by the induced emf travels in the direction that creates
a magnetic field with flux opposing the change in the original flux through
the circuit.
\end{Note}

This takes a moment to digest. Let's take an example\FRAME{dhF}{3.1592in}{%

'N8ESDBA8.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}Consider the case shown in the
picture. Suppose the $B$-field gets smaller in time. If that is the case,
then the induced current will try to keep the same number of field lines
going through the loop. To do this, it will have to add field lines, because
our field that is getting smaller will have fewer and fewer field lines. So
in this case, the induced field $\mathbf{\vec{B}}_{ind}$ will be in the same
direction as $\mathbf{\vec{B}}$ to try to keep the number of field lines the
same. We find the current using our current-carrying wire right hand rule\
for magnetism. We imagine grabbing the wire such that our fingers curl into
the loop the way $\mathbf{\vec{B}}_{ind}$ goes through the loop. Then our
thumb is in the direction of the current.

\section{Faraday}

In our motional emf problem, the sliding bar in the magnetic field creates a
potential difference, $\Delta V.$ It becomes an emf. We can use the symbol $%
\mathcal{E}$ for our emf.

But then in considering Lenz's law, it was experimentally found that any
change in flux causes a current. Then any change in flux must create an emf.

larger, and so the flux is getting larger. The induced current will oppose
the change. So the induced magnetic field should go up through the center of
the loop. Imagine sticking your fingers through the loop out of the page,
then grabbing the loop (fingers still out of the page in the inside of the
loop). Anywhere you grab the wire, your thumb is in the induced current
direction.

\subsection{Faraday's law of Magnetic Induction}

Faraday wrote an equation to describe the emf that was given by changing a $%
B $-field. It combines what we know about magnetic flux and current from
Lenz's law. Faraday did not know the source of the emf, it is a purely
empirical equation. Here it is

\begin{Note}
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{E}=-N\frac{\Delta \Phi _{B}}{\Delta t}
\end{equation}
\end{Note}

The $N$ is the number of turns in the coil (remember he used a coil, not
just one loop). $d\Phi _{B}$ is the change in the magnetic flux. Our
definition of magnetic flux is 
\begin{equation*}
\Phi _{B}=\int \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{A}}
\end{equation*}%
but for simple open surfaces we can gain some insight by writing the flux as 
\begin{equation*}
\Phi _{B}=BA\cos \theta
\end{equation*}%
Then the induced emf would be given by%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{E}=-N\frac{\left( B_{2}A_{2}\cos \theta _{2}-B_{1}A_{1}\cos \theta
_{1}\right) }{\Delta t}
\end{equation}%
and we see that we get an emf if $B,$ $A,$ or $\theta $ change. We can write
this as a differential if we let $\Delta t$ get very small.%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{E}=-N\frac{d\Phi _{B}}{dt}
\end{equation}

Suppose we have a simple flux $\Phi _{B}=\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}\cdot 
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{A}},$ then for this simple case 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathcal{E} &=&-N\frac{d}{dt}\left( \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}\cdot 
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{A}}\right) \\
&=&-N\left( \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}\cdot \frac{d}{dt}\overrightarrow{%
\mathbf{A}}+\overrightarrow{\mathbf{A}}\cdot \frac{d}{dt}\overrightarrow{%
\mathbf{B}}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

The first term shows our motional emf case. The area is changing in time.
But the second term shows that if the field changes, we get an emf. This is
the moving magnet in the coil case.

There are some great applications of induced emfs, from another design for
circuit breakers to electric guitar pickups!

\section{Return to Lenz's law}

Remember that Lenz's law says the current caused by the induced emf travels
in the direction that creates a magnetic field with flux opposing the change
in the original flux through the circuit. What if the current went the other
way?

If that happened, then we could set up our bar on the rails, and give it a
push to the right. With the current going down instead of up (for positive
charge carriers) then we would have a force on our bar-like segment of wire%
\begin{equation*}
F_{I}=BIL\sin \phi
\end{equation*}%
here $\sin \phi =1$ so 
\begin{equation*}
F_{I}=BIL
\end{equation*}%
It will be directed to the right. So the bar would accelerate to the right.
That would increase the size of the loop, increasing the current. That would
increase the force to the right, and our bar would soon zip off at amazing
speed. But that does not happen. It would take ever more energy to make the
bar go faster, with no input energy. So this would violate conservation of
energy. Really Lenz's law just gives us conservation of energy again.

\section{Pulling a loop from a magnetic field.}

Let's try a problem. Suppose we have a wire loop. The loop is rectangular,
with side lengths $\ell $ and $x.$ Further suppose that the loop is in a
region with magnetic field, but that it is on the edge of that field, so
that if we pull it to the right, it will leave the field.\FRAME{dhF}{2.5019in%
}{2.3713in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language "Scientific Word";type

2.3315in;cropleft "0";croptop "1";cropright "1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename
'N8ESDCAA.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}let's see if we can find the
induced emf and current.

The Magnetic flux through the loop is changing. We can find an expression
for the flux%
\begin{equation*}
\Phi _{B}=\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}\cdot \overrightarrow{\mathbf{A}}
\end{equation*}%
or in this case 
\begin{equation*}
\Phi _{B}=B\ell x
\end{equation*}%
We know the emf from Faraday's law 
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{E}=-N\frac{d\Phi _{B}}{dt}
\end{equation*}%
then 
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{E}=-\left( 1\right) \frac{d}{dt}\left( B\ell x\right)
\end{equation*}%
The field is not changing strength, and the length $\ell $ is not changing.
But along the $x$ side, we are losing field. Remember that $A$ in our flux
equation is the area that actually has field and we have less area that has
field all the time. We can see that 
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{E}=-\left( 1\right) \frac{d}{dt}\left( B\ell x\right) =-B\ell \frac{%
dx}{dt}=-B\ell v
\end{equation*}%
where $v$ is the speed at which we are pulling the wire loop. That is the
speed at which our flux changes.

We can use Ohm's law to find the current, 
\begin{equation*}
I=\frac{\Delta V}{R}=\frac{\mathcal{E}}{R}
\end{equation*}%
or%
\begin{equation*}
I=\frac{B\ell v}{R}
\end{equation*}

We could ask, how much work does it take to pull the wire out of the field?
This is like our capacitor problem where we pulled a dielectric out of the
middle of the capacitor.

The net force on the loop is not zero, because the field is no longer
uniform. The right hand side of the loop is outside the field, and the left
hand side is not. Of course, the top and bottom of the loop have opposite
forces that balance each other. So the net force is due to the left hand
side of the loop. Recall that%
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}=I\overrightarrow{\mathbf{L}}\times 
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}
\end{equation*}%
We can see that in this case $I\ $is upward, and $B$ is into the page. So
there is a force to the left resisting our change flux. We must pull to
overcome this force. The magnitude of this force is 
\begin{equation*}
F=I\ell B
\end{equation*}%
and we know $I$ so 
\begin{equation*}
F=\frac{B\ell v}{R}\ell B=\frac{B^{2}\ell ^{2}v}{R}
\end{equation*}

Now we need to find the work done. 
\begin{equation*}
W=\int Fdx
\end{equation*}%
or, since our force will be constant,%
\begin{equation*}
W=F\int dx
\end{equation*}%
which is not a hard integral to do. But instead of performing the integral,
let's look at the integrand. 
\begin{equation*}
dW=Fdx
\end{equation*}%
if we divide both sides of our equation by $dt$ we have 
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dW}{dt}=F\frac{dx}{dt}
\end{equation*}%
we know that $P=dW/dt$ and $\frac{dx}{dt}=v$ and so we can write our
equation as%
\begin{eqnarray*}
P &=&Fv \\
&=&\frac{B^{2}\ell ^{2}v^{2}}{R}
\end{eqnarray*}%
which is how much power the magnetic field force provides in resisting. We
must provide and equal power to move the loop. It will take time 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta t=\frac{\Delta x}{v}
\end{equation*}%
to pull the loop a distance $\Delta x.$ If we define our coordinates such
that $x_{i}=0$ then to pull out the loop, we will write this time as 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta t=\frac{x}{v}
\end{equation*}%
so the work is 
\begin{eqnarray*}
W &=&P\Delta t \\
&=&\frac{B^{2}\ell ^{2}v^{2}}{R}\frac{x}{v} \\
&=&\frac{B^{2}\ell ^{2}xv}{R}
\end{eqnarray*}

Incidentally, we learned from our demonstrations that induced currents can
take energy out of a system, creating heat energy. From Ohm's law the power
lost due to resistive heating would be 
\begin{eqnarray*}
P &=&I^{2}R \\
&=&\left( \frac{B\ell v}{R}\right) ^{2}R \\
&=&\frac{B2\ell ^{2}v^{2}}{R}
\end{eqnarray*}%
which is just the power we had to provide to make our loop move. So our work
has moved the loop and heated up the wire.

We have created a current in a wire. This is the first step in building a
generator. It cost us work to do this. In the next lecture, we will tackle
more practical design and build generators and transformers. Then we will
pause to think philosophically about what it means that a changing magnetic
flux creates an electric field.

Whether you are just plugging in an appliance, or preparing for an
emergency, you likely would think of a generator as a source of electrical
energy. Our studies so far have strongly hinted on how we would build an
electric generator. In this lecture, we will fill in the details.\FRAME{dhF}{%

We can learn a lot by studying this device as an example. The figure shows
the important parts of the generator (and a light bulb, which is not an
important part of a generator, but just represents some device that will use
the electrical current we make). The generator has at least one magnet. In
the figure, there is one with a north end on the left and a south end on the
right. A generator also has a wire loop. Usually in real generators, there
are thousands of turns of wire forming the loop. In our picture, there is
just one. The wire loop is connected to two metal rings. The rings will turn
as the loop turns. Metal contacts (brushes) that can slip along the rings,
but maintain an electrical connection, are placed on the rings. So as the
rings turn, current can still flow through the connected wires (to the light
bulb in this case).

This should look familiar. This is the same basic setup as the motor, with a
few exceptions. An important exception is that the commutator has been
replaced by the set of rings. We will call these ring contacts \emph{slip
rings} because the wires can slip along them while still maintaining
electrical contact because of the brushes. We have a current loop in a
(nearly) uniform, constant field. If I look from the slip ring side of the
loop, I\ have the same geometry we had before when we considered motors.
This time I want to consider doing work to turn the loop, and find the
induced emf in the loop. We start with Faraday's law%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{E}=-N\frac{d\Phi _{B}}{dt}
\end{equation}%
since in our special case we only have one loop, this is just%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{E}=-\frac{d\Phi _{B}}{dt}
\end{equation}%
Here is a the view looking at the cross section of the loop facing toward
the slip rings.\FRAME{dtbpF}{3.3001in}{3.0502in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special%

"1";cropright "1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename
'N8ESDCAC.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}Let's consider the flux through
the loop. The definition we have for flux is%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Phi _{B} &=&\mathbf{B}\cdot \mathbf{A} \\
&=&BA\cos \theta \\
&=&BA_{proj}
\end{eqnarray*}%
where $\theta $ is the angle between the loop area vector and the magnetic
field direction.

I want to write the flux in terms of the lengths of the wire. When the loop
is standing up straight along the $y$-direction the projected area is just
the area%
\begin{equation*}
A=\ell a
\end{equation*}%
Then the projected area is 
\begin{equation*}
A_{proj}=\ell a\cos \theta
\end{equation*}
Let's check to make sure this works. When the loop is standing up straight
along the $y$-direction $\theta =0\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{b0}}%
%BeginExpansion
{{}^\circ}%
%EndExpansion
},$ and $\cos \theta =1$ so 
\begin{equation*}
A_{_{proj}\max }=\ell a\cos \theta =\ell a
\end{equation*}%
so this works.

To find the emf generated, I\ need 
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{E}=-\frac{d\Phi _{B}}{dt}
\end{equation*}%
and only the projected area is changing (really, only the angle is
changing). So 
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{E}=-\frac{d\Phi _{B}}{dt}=-B\frac{dA_{proj}}{dt}
\end{equation*}%
We realize that $\theta $ must change in time. We remember from PH\ 121 or
Dynamics that we can use $\theta =\omega t$ where $\omega $ is the angular
speed of the rotating loop. Then%
\begin{equation*}
A_{proj}=\ell a\cos \omega t
\end{equation*}%
and%
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{E}=-\frac{d\Phi _{B}}{dt}=-B\frac{d}{dt}\ell a\cos \omega t
\end{equation*}%
We recognize that $\theta $ changes as the loop turns Since $B$ is not
changing, the change in flux per unit time is just $B$ times the change in
area with time.

\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{E}=B\ell a\omega \sin \left( \omega t\right)
\end{equation*}%
Look at what we got! it is a sinusoidal emf. This will make a sinusoidal
current! 
\begin{eqnarray*}
I &=&\frac{\mathcal{E}}{R} \\
&=&\frac{B\ell a\omega \sin \left( \omega t\right) }{R}
\end{eqnarray*}%
for a circuit. Our emf looks like 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{E}=\mathcal{E}_{\max }\sin \left( \omega t\right)
\end{equation}%
where%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{E}_{\max }=B\ell a\omega

Of course this sinusoidal emf will create what we call an \emph{alternating
current}. This is how the current in the outlets in your house is generated.

Of course, our generator only has one coil. Actual generators have multiple
coils. \FRAME{dhFU}{2.7812in}{1.6604in}{0pt}{\Qcb{Double Armature Generator

have a gasoline powered generator, or in a nuclear reactor you might have a

to a magnetic field is common to all electric generators.

\subsection{DC current from a generator}

We can also make a non-alternating current with a generator, but we have to
get tricky to do it. We use the same idea we used to make a motor. We cut
slots in the slip rings, so the current will switch directions every half
turn. We get a kind of poor quality current from this because the emf still
varies a lot. \FRAME{dtbpFX}{2.6161in}{1.7443in}{0pt}{}{}{Plot}{\special%

generators for non-alternating or \emph{direct current} generators by
overlapping several current loops at different angles. Each loop has it's
own cut slip rings. The combined currents smooth out the ripples we see in
the previous figure. For semiconductor devices, special circuits are used to
make the current very smooth.

\subsection{Back emf}

We can see that a motor is a DC generator run backwards. I just want to
mention that when we talk about motors, we have to realize that as we send
current into the motor coils, there will be an induced emf that will try to
maintain the existing flux as the motor's loops turn. This emf will be in
the opposite direction of the applied current! So it reduces the amount of
work the motor can do. This is like the resistive force we encountered when
we pulled a loop from a magnetic field last lecture. This resistive force is
called the \emph{back emf} and must be accounted for in motor design.

The power comes into our houses at about $120V$. Your iPhone probably
requires $3\unit{V}$ to $5\unit{V}.$ How do we get the voltage we want out
of what the power company delivers? You know the answer is to plug in your
phone using a special adaptor. Lets see how it works.

Let's consider Faraday's law again. We know that 
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{E=}\Delta V\left( t\right) =-N\frac{d\Phi }{dt}
\end{equation*}%
Suppose we use Faraday's idea and hook two coils up next to each other.%

alternating emf. We will call this side coil $1$. The other side we will
hook a second coil with some resistive load like a light bulb. We will call
this coil $2.$The iron core keeps the magnetic field inside, so the flux
through coil $1$ ends up going through coil $2.$ (think of all the little
domains in the iron lining up along the field lines, and enhancing the field
lines with their own induced fields).

The alternating potential from the source will create a change in flux in
coil $1.$%
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V_{1}=-N_{1}\frac{d\Phi _{1}}{dt}
\end{equation*}%
if little flux is lost in the iron, then we will retrieve most of the flux
in coil $2$ and an emf will be induced in the resister (light bulb in our
case).%
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V_{2}=-N_{2}\frac{d\Phi _{2}}{dt}
\end{equation*}%
we just convinced ourselves that 
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d\Phi _{1}}{dt}\approx \frac{d\Phi _{2}}{dt}
\end{equation*}%
so we can solve each equation for the change in flux term, and set them
equal.%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{\Delta V_{1}}{N_{1}} &=&-\frac{d\Phi _{1}}{dt} \\
\frac{\Delta V_{2}}{N_{2}} &=&-\frac{d\Phi _{2}}{dt}
\end{eqnarray*}%
so we have%
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta V_{1}}{N_{1}}=\frac{\Delta V_{2}}{N_{2}}
\end{equation}%
If we solve for $\Delta V_{2}$ we can find the emf in coil $2.$%
\begin{equation}
\frac{N_{2}}{N_{1}}\Delta V_{1}=\Delta V_{2}

You have probably already guessed how we make $\Delta V_{2}$ to be some emf
amount we want. We take, say, our wall current that has a value\footnote{%
Really this should be an rms voltage, but we have not studied alternating
current yet, so for now we will just call it a voltage.} of $\Delta V_{1}=120%
\unit{V}$. We pass it through this device we have built. We design the
device so that $\frac{N_{2}}{N_{1}}\Delta V_{1}$ gives just the potential
that we want for $\Delta V_{2}.$ If we want a lower emf, say $12\unit{V},$
then we make $\frac{N_{2}}{N_{1}}=0.1$ so 
\begin{equation}
\frac{N_{2}}{N_{1}}\Delta V_{1}=0.1\left( 120\unit{V}\right) =12\unit{V}
\end{equation}%
This is part of what the wall adaptor does. Usually wall adapters also have
some circuitry to make the alternating current into direct current.

Note that there is a cost to doing this. The power must be the same on both
sides (or a little less on side $2$). So 
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{P}_{av}=I_{1,rms}\Delta V_{1,rms}=I_{2,rms}\Delta V_{2,rms}
\end{equation*}%
We can change the emf, but it will effect our ability to supply current.

This device is called a transformer. Real transformers do lose power. Some
loss is due to the fact that not all the $B$-field from coil $1$ makes it
inside coil $2.$ But real transformers are not too bad with efficiencies
ranging from $90\%$ to $99\%$.

\section{Induced Electric Fields}

Consider again a magnetic field and a moving charge. If the field changes,
the flux changes. Say, for example, that the field is increasing in strength.%

within the wire. We now understand that this is because we have induced an
emf. But think again about a battery.

The battery makes an electric field inside a wire. Recall this figure\FRAME{%

there is no wire, so the $E$-field must be there whether or not there is a
wire.\FRAME{dhF}{3.0191in}{2.4137in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

This is quite a profound statement. We have said that a changing magnetic
field \emph{creates} an electric field. Before, only charges could create
electric fields, but in this case, the magnetic field is creating the
electric field. Of course, we know that moving charges are making the
magnetic field, so it is not totally surprising that the fields would be
related.

This electric field is just like a field produced by charges in that it
exerts a force 
\begin{equation*}
F=q_{o}E
\end{equation*}%
on a charge $q_{o}.$ But the electric field source is now very different.

It would be good to obtain the most general relationship we can that relates
the electric field to the magnetic field. By understanding this
relationship, we can\ hope to gain insight into how to build things, and
into how the universe works. Let's start with a thought experiment.

Suppose we have a uniform but time varying magnetic field into the paper. In
this field, we have a conducting ring. If the field strength is increasing,
then the charges in the conducting loop shown will feel an induced emf, and
they will form a current that is tangent to the ring.

Let's find the work required to move a charge once around the loop. The
amount of potential energy difference is equal to the work done, so 
\begin{equation*}
\left\vert \Delta U\right\vert =\left\vert W\right\vert
\end{equation*}%
but in terms of the electric potential this is 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta U=q\Delta V=q\mathcal{E}
\end{equation*}%
so%
\begin{equation*}
\left\vert W\right\vert =\left\vert q\mathcal{E}\right\vert
\end{equation*}%
Now let's do this another way. Let's use 
\begin{equation*}
W=\int \mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{s}
\end{equation*}%
The force making the current move is due to the induced potential
difference. This is just 
\begin{equation*}
F=qE
\end{equation*}%
which will not change as we go around the loop. The path will be along the
loop, so 
\begin{equation*}
W=\int_{loop}Fds
\end{equation*}%
and since the $E$-field is uniform in space at any given time as we travel
around the loop, 
\begin{equation*}
W=F\int_{loop}ds=qE2\pi r
\end{equation*}%
So we have two expressions for the work. Let's set them equal to each other%
\begin{equation*}
q\mathcal{E}=qE2\pi r
\end{equation*}%
The electric field is then%
\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathcal{E}}{2\pi r}=E
\end{equation}%
but 
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{E}=-N\frac{d\Phi _{B}}{dt}
\end{equation*}%
so%
\begin{eqnarray*}
E &=&\frac{-N}{2\pi r}\frac{d\Phi _{B}}{dt} \\
&=&\frac{-1}{2\pi r}\frac{d\Phi _{B}}{dt}
\end{eqnarray*}

So if we know how our $B$-field varies in time, we can find the $E$-field
that the changing $B$-field induces. Let's rewrite this one more time%
\begin{equation*}
2\pi rE=-\frac{d\Phi _{B}}{dt}
\end{equation*}%
Since the $E$-field is constant in as we go around the loop, we can
recognize the LHS as%
\begin{equation*}
2\pi rE=\int \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}
\end{equation*}%
which should be little surprise, since we found 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=\int \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}
\end{equation*}%
to be our basic definition of the electric potential. So%
\begin{equation}
\int \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}=-\frac{%
d\Phi _{B}}{dt}
\end{equation}%
This is a more general form of Faraday's law of induction.

This electric field is fundamentally different than the $E$-fields we
studied before. It is not a static field. If it were, then $\int 
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}$ would be zero
around a ring of current. Think of Kirchhoff's loop rule. Around a closed
loop $\Delta V=0$ normally. Then 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=\int \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}%
\mathbf{=0\qquad }\text{no magnetic field}
\end{equation*}%
But since$\int \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}%
\neq 0$ for our induced $E$-field, we must recognize that this field is
different from those made by static charges. We call this field that does
not return the charge to the same energy state on traversing the loop a 
\emph{nonconservative field}. It is still just an electric field, but we are
gaining energy from the magnetic field, so $\Delta V$ around the loop is not
zero.

The equation 
\begin{equation}
\int \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}=-\frac{%
d\Phi _{B}}{dt}
\end{equation}%
is the most general form of Faraday's equation, but it is hard to use in
calculation for normal circuits where there is no magnetic field or where
the fields are weak. So we won't use it as we design normal circuits (we
will use the idea of inductance instead, which we will soon study). But it
plays a large part in the electromagnetic theory of optics (PH375). We will
just get a taste of this here.

There is no requirement that the universe display such symmetry, but we have
found that it usually does. Indeed, a changing electric field creates a
magnetic field.

This foreshadows our final study of light. We learned earlier that light is
an \emph{electromagnetic} wave. What this means is that light is a wave in
both the electric \emph{and} magnetic fields.

Maxwell first predicted that such a wave could exist. The electric field of
the wave changes in time like a sinusoid. But this change will produce a
magnetic field that will also change in time. This changing magnetic field
recreates the electric field--which recreates the magnetic field, etc. Thus
the electromagnetic wave is \emph{self-sustaining}. It can break off from
the charges that create it and keep going forever because the electric field
and magnetic field of the wave create each other. You often see the
electromagnetic wave drawn like this:\FRAME{dhF}{1.8343in}{1.9657in}{0pt}{}{%

and magnetic fields being created and recreated to make the wave self
sustaining.

This is a direct result of Maxwell's study of electromagnetic field theory.
Our more complete version of Faraday's law is one of the fundamental
equations describing electromagnetic waves known as \emph{Maxwell's
Equations.}%
\begin{equation*}
\int \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}=-\frac{%
d\Phi _{B}}{dt}
\end{equation*}%
You might guess that the symmetry we have observed would give another
similar equation relating the magnetic field and the electric flux.%
\begin{equation*}
\int \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}=+\frac{%
d\Phi _{E}}{dt}
\end{equation*}%
and we will find that this is true! But we have yet to show that is so. Note
that $\int \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}$
shows up in Ampere's law, 
\begin{equation*}
\int \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}\mathbf{%
=\mu }_{o}I
\end{equation*}%
so this last equation is not complete, but we are guessing that there is
also the possibility of an induced magnetic field from a changing electric
field, so we can predict that we need to modify Ampere's law to be%
\begin{equation*}
\int \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}\mathbf{%
=\mu }_{o}I+\frac{d\Phi _{E}}{dt}
\end{equation*}%
but again we will have to show this later.

In the next lecture, we will take a break from this deep theoretical
discussion, and learn how to use induction to make useful circuit devices.

When we put capacitors and resisters in a circuit, we found that the current
did not jump to it's ultimate current value all at once. There was a time
dependence. But really, even if we just have a resister (and we always have
some resistance) the current does not reach it's full value instantaneously.
Think of our circuits, they are current loops! So as the current starts to
flow, Lenz's law tells us that there will be an induced emf that will oppose
the flow. The potential drop across the resister in a simple
battery-resister circuit is the potential drop due to the battery emf, \emph{%
minus the induced emf}.

We can use this fact to control current in circuits. To see how, we can
study a new case\FRAME{dhF}{1.977in}{1.0378in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special%

'N8ESDEAR.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}Let's take a coil of wire wound
around an iron cylindrical core. We start with a current as shown in the
figure above. Using our right hand rule we can find the direction of the $B$%
-field. But we now will allow the current to change. As it gets larger, we
know 
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{E}=-N\frac{d\Phi _{B}}{dt}
\end{equation*}

and we know that as the current changes, the magnitude of the $B$-field will
change, so the flux through the coil will change. We will have an induced
emf. We could derive this expression, but I think you can see that the
induced emf is proportional to the \emph{rate of change} of the current.%
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{E}\equiv -L\frac{\Delta I}{\Delta t}
\end{equation*}

You might ask if the number of loops in the coil matters. The answer
is--yes. Does the size and shape of the coil matter--yes. But we will
include all these geometrical effects in the constant $L$ called the \emph{%
inductance}. It will hold all the material properties of the iron cored coil.%
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{E}=-N\frac{d\Phi _{B}}{dt}\equiv -L\frac{dI}{dt}
\end{equation*}%
so for this case%
\begin{equation*}
-N\frac{d\Phi _{B}}{dt}\frac{dt}{dI}\equiv -L
\end{equation*}%
or%
\begin{equation*}
L=N\frac{d\Phi _{B}}{dI}
\end{equation*}%
If we start with no current (so no flux), then our change in flux is the
current flux minus zero. We can then say that%
\begin{equation*}
L=N\frac{\Phi _{B}}{I}
\end{equation*}

It might be more useful to write the inductance as 
\begin{equation*}
L=-\frac{\mathcal{E}_{L}}{\frac{dI}{dt}}
\end{equation*}
In designing circuits, we will usually just look up the inductance of the
device we choose, like we looked up the resistance of resisters or the
capacitance of the capacitors we use.

But for our special case of a simple coil, we can calculate the inductance,
because we know the induced emf using Faraday's law

\subsection{Inductance of a solenoid\protect\footnote{%
Think of this like the special case of a capacitor made from two flat large
plates, the parallel plate capacitor. It was somewhat ideal in the way we
treated it. Our treatment of the special case of a coil will likewise be

Let's extend our calculation for our coil. Really the only easy case we can
do is that of a solenoid (that's probably a hint for the test). So let's do
it! We will just fill our solenoid with air instead of iron (if we have
iron, we have to take into account the magnetization, so it is not terribly
hard, but this is not what we\ want to concentrate on now). If the solenoid
has $N$ turns with length $L$ and we assume that $L$ is much bigger than the
radius $r$ of the loops then we can use our solution for the $B$-field
created by a solenoid%
\begin{eqnarray*}
B &=&\mu _{o}nI \\
&=&\mu _{o}\frac{N}{\ell }I
\end{eqnarray*}%
The flux through each turn is then 
\begin{equation*}
\Phi _{B}=BA=\mu _{o}\frac{N}{\ell }IA
\end{equation*}%
where $A$ is the area of one of the solenoid loops. Then we use our equation
for inductance for a coil%
\begin{eqnarray*}
L &=&N\frac{\Phi _{B}}{I} \\
&=&N\frac{\left( \mu _{o}\frac{N}{\ell }IA\right) }{I} \\
&=&\frac{\left( \mu _{o}N^{2}A\right) }{\ell } \\
&=&\frac{\left( \mu _{o}N^{2}A\right) }{\ell }\frac{\ell }{\ell } \\
&=&\frac{\mu _{o}N^{2}A\ell }{\ell ^{2}} \\
&=&\frac{\mu _{o}N^{2}V}{\ell ^{2}} \\
&=&\mu _{o}n^{2}V
\end{eqnarray*}%
where we used the fact that the volume of the solenoid is $V=A\ell .$

Many inductors built for use in electronics are just this, air filled
solenoids. So this really is a somewhat practical solution.

An inductor, like a capacitor, stores energy in it's field. We would like to
know how much energy an inductor can store. From basic circuit theory we
know the power in a circuit will be%
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{P}=I\Delta V
\end{equation*}%
If we just have an inductor, then the power removed from the circuit is 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathcal{P}_{cir} &=&I\Delta V=I\mathcal{E} \\
&=&I\left( -L\frac{dI}{dt}\right) \\
&=&-LI\frac{dI}{dt}
\end{eqnarray*}%
As with a resistor, we are taking power \emph{from the circuit} so the
result is negative. But unlike a resistor, this power is not being
dissipated as heat. It is going into the magnetic field of the inductor.
Therefore, we expect the power stored in the inductor field to be 
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{P}_{L}=-\mathcal{P}_{cir}=LI\frac{dI}{dt}
\end{equation*}%
Power is the time rate of change of energy , so we can write this power
delivered to the inductor as 
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dU_{L}}{dt}=LI\frac{dI}{dt}
\end{equation*}%
Multiplying by $dt$ gives%
\begin{equation*}
dU_{L}=LIdI
\end{equation*}%
To find the total energy stored in the inductor we must integrate over $I.$%
\begin{eqnarray*}
U_{L} &=&\int dU_{L} \\
&=&\int_{0}^{I}LIdI \\
&=&L\int_{0}^{I}IdI \\
&=&\frac{1}{2}LI^{2}
\end{eqnarray*}

Thus, 
\begin{equation*}
U_{L}=\frac{1}{2}LI^{2}
\end{equation*}%
is the energy stored in the magnetic field of the inductor.

Suppose we have an inductor $L=30.0\times 10^{-3}\unit{H}.$ Plotting shows
us the dependence of $U_{L}$ on $I.$

We should take a moment to see how our inductor compares to a capacitor as
an energy storage device. The energy stored in the electric field of a
capacitor%
\begin{equation*}
U_{L}=\frac{1}{2}L\left( I\right) ^{2}
\end{equation*}%
\begin{equation*}
U_{C}=\frac{1}{2}C\left( \Delta V\right) ^{2}
\end{equation*}%
Notice that Remarkable similarity!

We found that there was energy stored in the electric field of a capacitor.
Is the energy stored in the inductor really stored in the magnetic field of
the inductor? We believe that this is just the case, the energy, $U_{L},$ is
stored in the field. We would like to have an expression for the density of
the energy in the field.

To see this, let's start with the inductance of a solenoid.%
\begin{equation*}
L=\mu _{o}n^{2}A\ell
\end{equation*}%
The magnetic field is given by

\begin{equation*}
B=\mu _{o}nI
\end{equation*}%
then the energy in the field is given by 
\begin{eqnarray*}
U_{B} &=&\frac{1}{2}LI^{2} \\
&=&\frac{1}{2}\mu _{o}n^{2}A\ell I^{2}
\end{eqnarray*}%
If we rearrange this, we can see the solenoid field is found in the
expression twice%
\begin{eqnarray*}
U_{B} &=&\frac{1}{2}\left( \mu _{o}nI\right) A\ell \frac{\mu _{o}}{\mu _{o}}%
nI \\
&=&\frac{1}{2\mu _{o}}B^{2}A\ell
\end{eqnarray*}%
and the energy density is 
\begin{eqnarray*}
u_{B} &=&\frac{U_{B}}{A\ell } \\
&=&\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{\mu _{o}}B^{2}
\end{eqnarray*}

Just like our energy density for the electric field, we derived this for a
specific case, a solenoid. But this expression is general. We should compare
to the energy density in the electric field.

\begin{equation*}
u_{E}=\frac{1}{2}\epsilon _{o}E^{2}
\end{equation*}%
Again, note the similarity!

Assumption 2: There is no radiation emitted from the circuit.

Given these two assumptions, there is no mechanism for energy to escape the
circuit. Energy must be conserved. Can we describe the charge on the
capacitor, the current, and the energy as a function of time?

Remember from Dynamics or PH121 that a mass-spring system will oscillate.
The mass has kinetic energy because the mass is moving 
\begin{equation}
K=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}
\end{equation}%
for our Simple Harmonic Oscillator we know that the position of the mass as
a function of time is given by 
\begin{equation*}
x\left( t\right) =x_{\max }\cos \left( \omega t+\phi \right)
\end{equation*}%
and the speed as a function of time is 
\begin{equation*}
v\left( t\right) =-\omega x_{\max }\sin \left( \omega t+\phi \right)
\end{equation*}%
then the kinetic energy as a function of time is%
\begin{eqnarray*}
K &=&\frac{1}{2}m\left( -\omega x_{\max }\sin \left( \omega t+\phi \right)
\right) ^{2} \\
&=&\frac{1}{2}m\omega ^{2}x_{\max }^{2}\sin ^{2}\left( \omega t+\phi \right)
\\
&=&\frac{1}{2}m\frac{k}{m}x_{\max }^{2}\sin ^{2}\left( \omega t+\phi \right)
\\
&=&\frac{1}{2}kx_{\max }^{2}\sin ^{2}\left( \omega t+\phi \right)
\end{eqnarray*}%
The spring has potential energy given by 
\begin{equation}
U=\frac{1}{2}kx^{2}
\end{equation}%
For our mechanical oscillator the potential as a function of time is%
\begin{equation*}
U=\frac{1}{2}kx_{\max }^{2}\cos ^{2}\left( \omega t+\phi \right)
\end{equation*}%
The total energy is given by%
\begin{eqnarray*}
E &=&K+U \\
&=&\frac{1}{2}kx_{\max }^{2}\sin ^{2}\left( \omega t+\phi \right) +\frac{1}{2%
}kx_{\max }^{2}\cos ^{2}\left( \omega t+\phi \right) \\
&=&\frac{1}{2}kx_{\max }^{2}\left( \sin ^{2}\left( \omega t+\phi \right)
+\cos ^{2}\left( \omega t+\phi \right) \right) \\
&=&\frac{1}{2}kx_{\max }^{2}
\end{eqnarray*}

If we plot the kinetic and potential energies it looks like this\FRAME{dtbpF%

We can see that the total energy won't change, and the energy switches back
and forth from kinetic to potential as the mass moves back and forth. If we
plot the kinetic and potential energy at points along the mass' path we get
something like this.

One of the important uses of an inductor is to create \emph{electrical
oscillations.} Having recalled what oscillations look like, we can see that
a LC circuit will have an oscillating current.

here is our circuit again.\FRAME{dtbpF}{2.1958in}{1.6042in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{%

We will start with the switch open the capacitor charged to its maximum
value $Q_{\max }.$ For $t>0$ the switch is closed. Recall that the energy
stored in the capacitor is 
\begin{equation*}
U_{C}=\frac{Q^{2}}{2C}
\end{equation*}%
and the energy stored in the inductor is%
\begin{equation*}
U_{L}=\frac{1}{2}I^{2}L
\end{equation*}%
The total energy (because of our assumptions) is%
\begin{eqnarray*}
U &=&U_{C}+U_{L} \\
&=&\frac{Q^{2}}{2C}+\frac{1}{2}I^{2}L
\end{eqnarray*}%
The change in energy over time must be zero (again because of our
assumptions) so%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{dU}{dt} &=&0 \\
&=&\frac{d}{dt}\left( \frac{Q^{2}}{2C}+\frac{1}{2}I^{2}L\right) \\
&=&\frac{Q}{C}\frac{dQ}{dt}+LI\frac{dI}{dt}
\end{eqnarray*}%
We recall that 
\begin{equation*}
I=\frac{dQ}{dt}
\end{equation*}

\begin{eqnarray*}
0 &=&\frac{Q}{C}\left( \frac{dQ}{dt}\right) +LI\frac{dI}{dt} \\
0 &=&\frac{Q}{C}\left( I\right) +LI\frac{dI}{dt} \\
0 &=&\frac{Q}{C}I+LI\frac{d\left( \frac{dQ}{dt}\right) }{dt} \\
0 &=&\frac{Q}{C}+L\frac{d^{2}Q}{dt^{2}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
or%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d^{2}Q}{dt^{2}}=-\frac{Q}{LC}
\end{equation*}%
This is a differential equation that we recognize from M316. It looks just
like the differential equation for oscillatory motion! We try a solution of
the form%
\begin{equation*}
Q=A\cos \left( \omega t+\phi \right)
\end{equation*}%
then%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dQ}{dt}=-A\omega \sin \left( \omega t+\phi \right)
\end{equation*}%
and%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d^{2}Q}{dt^{2}}=-A\omega ^{2}\cos \left( \omega t+\phi \right)
\end{equation*}%
thus%
\begin{equation*}
A\omega ^{2}\cos \left( \omega t+\phi \right) =-\frac{1}{LC}A\cos \left(
\omega t+\phi \right)
\end{equation*}%
This is indeed a solution if 
\begin{equation*}
\omega =\frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}
\end{equation*}%
When $\cos \left( \omega t+\phi \right) =1$, $Q=Q_{\max },$ thus 
\begin{equation*}
Q=Q_{\max }\cos \left( \omega t+\phi \right)
\end{equation*}

Now recall, 
\begin{eqnarray*}
I &=&\frac{dQ}{dt} \\
&=&\frac{d}{dt}\left( Q_{\max }\cos \left( \omega t+\phi \right) \right) \\
&=&-\omega Q_{\max }\sin \left( \omega t+\phi \right)
\end{eqnarray*}

We would like to determine $\phi .$ We use the initial conditions $t=0,$ $%
I=0 $ and $Q=Q_{\max }.$ Then

\begin{equation*}
0=-\omega Q_{\max }\sin \left( \phi \right)
\end{equation*}%
This is true for $\phi =0.$ Then%
\begin{eqnarray*}
Q &=&Q_{\max }\cos \left( \omega t\right) \\
I &=&-\omega Q_{\max }\sin \left( \omega t\right) \\
&=&-I_{\max }\sin \left( \omega t\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

We can use the solution for the charge on the capacitor and the current in
the inductor as a function of time to expand our energy equation%
\begin{eqnarray*}
U &=&U_{C}+U_{L} \\
&=&\frac{Q^{2}}{2C}+\frac{1}{2}I^{2}L \\
&=&\frac{1}{2C}Q_{\max }^{2}\cos ^{2}\left( \omega t\right) +\frac{1}{2}%
LI_{\max }^{2}\sin ^{2}\left( \omega t\right)
\end{eqnarray*}%
This looks a lot like our kinetic and potential energy equation for a
mass-spring system. The energy shifts from the capacitor to the inductor and
back like energy shifted from kinetic to potential energy for our
mass-spring, with the components out of phase by $90\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{b0}}%
%BeginExpansion
{{}^\circ}%
%EndExpansion
}.$ By energy conservation, we know that 
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{2C}Q_{\max }^{2}=\frac{1}{2}LI_{\max }^{2}
\end{equation*}%
that is, the maximum energy in the capacitor equals the maximum energy in
the inductor. Then the total energy%
\begin{eqnarray*}
U &=&\frac{1}{2C}Q_{\max }^{2}\cos ^{2}\left( \omega t\right) +\frac{1}{2}%
LI_{\max }^{2}\sin ^{2}\left( \omega t\right) \\
&=&\frac{1}{2C}Q_{\max }^{2}\cos ^{2}\left( \omega t\right) +\frac{1}{2C}%
Q_{\max }^{2}\sin ^{2}\left( \omega t\right) \\
&=&\frac{Q_{\max }^{2}}{2C}
\end{eqnarray*}%
which must be the case if energy is conserved. We can plot the capacitor and
inductor energies at points in time as the current switches back and forth.%

oscillatory circuit to operate.

\subsection{The RLC circuit}

As fascinating as the last section was, we know there really is some
resistance in the wire. So the restriction of no resistance needs to be
relaxed in our analysis.

\FRAME{dhF}{2.0755in}{1.6466in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

"1";cropright "1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename
'N8ESDEB0.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}We can use the circuit in the
picture to imagine an LRC circuit. At first, we will keep $S_{2}$ open and
close $S_{1}$ to charge up the capacitor. Then we will close $S_{1}$ and
open $S_{2}.$ What will happen?

It is easier to find the current and charge on the capacitor as a function
of time by using energy arguments. The resistor will remove energy from the
circuit by dissipation (getting hot). The circuit has energy%
\begin{equation}
U=\frac{Q^{2}}{2C}+\frac{1}{2}LI^{2}
\end{equation}%
so from the work energy theorem, 
\begin{equation*}
W_{nc}=\Delta U
\end{equation*}%
the energy lost will be related to a change in the energy in the capacitor
and the inductor. Let's look at the rate of energy loss again

\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{dU}{dt} &=&\frac{d}{dt}\left( \frac{Q^{2}}{2C}+\frac{1}{2}LI^{2}\right)
\\
&=&\frac{Q}{C}\frac{dQ}{dt}+LI\frac{dI}{dt}  \notag
\end{eqnarray}%
but this must be equal to the loss rate. The power lost will be $P=I^{2}R$%
\begin{equation}
-I^{2}R=\frac{Q}{C}\frac{dQ}{dt}+LI\frac{dI}{dt}
\end{equation}%
This is a differential equation we can solve, let's first rearrange,
remembering that 
\begin{equation*}
I=\frac{dQ}{dt}
\end{equation*}%
then%
\begin{eqnarray*}
-I^{2}R &=&\frac{Q}{C}I+LI\frac{dI}{dt} \\
-IR &=&\frac{Q}{C}+L\frac{dI}{dt}
\end{eqnarray*}%
again using $I=\frac{dQ}{dt}$%
\begin{equation}
+L\frac{d^{2}Q}{dt^{2}}+\frac{dQ}{dt}R+\frac{Q}{C}=0
\end{equation}%
This is a good exercise for those of you who have taken math 316. This is
just like the equation governing a damped harmonic oscillator. The solution
is 
\begin{equation}
Q=Q_{\max }e^{-\frac{Rt}{2L}}\cos \omega _{d}t
\end{equation}%
where the angular frequency, $\omega _{d}$ is given by 
\begin{equation}
\omega _{d}=\left( \frac{1}{LC}-\left( \frac{R}{2L}\right) ^{2}\right) ^{%
\frac{1}{2}}
\end{equation}

Remember that for a damped harmonic oscillator 
\begin{equation*}
x\left( t\right) =Ae^{-\frac{b}{2m}t}\cos \left( \omega t+\phi \right)
\end{equation*}%
and 
\begin{equation*}
\omega =\left( \frac{k}{m}-\left( \frac{b}{2m}\right) ^{2}\right) ^{\frac{1}{%
2}}
\end{equation*}

The resistance acts like a damping coefficient! Suppose

\begin{equation*}
\begin{tabular}{l}
$Q_{\max }=0.05\unit{C}$ \\ 
$R=5\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%

\begin{equation}
\omega _{d}=\left( \frac{1}{LC}-\left( \frac{R}{2L}\right) ^{2}\right) ^{%
\frac{1}{2}}

If $\omega _{d}=0$ then

\end{eqnarray*}%
or%
\begin{equation}
R=\sqrt{\frac{4L}{C}}
\end{equation}%
We know that if $\omega _{d}=0$ there is no oscillation. We will call this
the critical resistance, $R_{c}.$ When the resistance is $R\geq R_{c}$ there
will be no oscillation. These represent the cases of being critically damped 
$\left( R=R_{c}\right) $ and overdamped $\left( R>R_{c}\right) .$ If $%
R<R_{c} $ we are underdamped, and the circuit will oscillate.

We don't know how to make electromagnetic waves yet, but we will in a few
lecture. Those waves carry what we call radio signals. To make the waves, we
often use circuits with resisters, capacitors, and inductors to provide the
oscillation. You can guess that if $Q$ on the capacitor oscillates, so does
the current. This oscillating current is what we use to drive the radio
antenna.

Now that we have some resistance, we could consider a circuit with just an
inductor and a resistor and a battery.\FRAME{dhF}{2.0028in}{1.5123in}{0pt}{}{%

\section{Return to Non-Conservative Fields}

A few decades ago, we could have stopped here in an engineering class in
considering and LRC\ circuit. But as electrical devices become every more
complicated, it might be good if we examine circuits with inductors and
resistors more carefully. A few lectures ago we found that 
\begin{equation*}
\int \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{s}=-\frac{d\Phi _{B}}{dt}
\end{equation*}%
implies a non-conservative electric field. We should take a moment to see
what this means. We should also, if we have time, investigate mutual
inductance, which has become a major engineering technique for wireless
power. First let's consider the following circuit.\cite{lewin2002}\FRAME{%

and now we use the junction and loop rules to find the voltages.

But recall that 
\begin{equation*}
\doint \mathbf{E}\cdot ds=0
\end{equation*}%
was the basis for Kirchhoff's loop rule. And we learned that this is not
true for induced emfs. So in the middle loop Kirchhoff's loop rule is not
true! We now know that because of the changing magnetic field, 
\begin{equation*}
\doint \mathbf{E}\cdot ds=\mathcal{E}=-\frac{d\Phi _{B}}{dt}
\end{equation*}%
for this middle loop. Now then, $\mathcal{E}$ comes just from the changing
external flux. It does \emph{not} depend on $R_{1}$ or on $R_{2}.$

We can write a Kirchhoff's law-like equation for each loop.%
\begin{eqnarray*}
I_{1}R_{i}-IR_{1} &=&0 \\
-IR_{1}-IR_{2}+\mathcal{E} &=&0 \\
I_{2}R_{i}-IR_{2} &=&0
\end{eqnarray*}%
where $R_{i}$ is the internal resistance of the voltmeters. If there were no 
$\mathcal{E}$, then the volt meters would certainly not read anything, but
now we see that 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\left\vert V_{1}\right\vert &=&I_{1}R_{i}\approx IR_{1} \\
\left\vert V_{2}\right\vert &=&I_{2}R_{i}\approx IR_{2}
\end{eqnarray*}%
This seems crazy. Each volt meter reads a different voltage.

To understand this, remember that our induced field is not a conservative
field. As we go around the loop we no longer expect to get back to our
starting voltage. We have lost some energy in making a magnetic field. And
for non-conservative fields, $\doint \mathbf{E}\cdot ds$ \emph{is path
dependent}.

So as crazy as it seems, this is actually what we would find, each volt
meter reads a different voltage.

To try to make this idea of inductance make some sense, let's take another
strange circuit.\FRAME{dtbpF}{1.382in}{0.8077in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special%

and a single loop inductor. When the switch is thrown, the current will flow
as shown. The current will create a magnetic field that is out of the page
in the center of the loop. Since the loop, itself, is creating this field,
let's call this field a \emph{self field}.\FRAME{dtbpF}{1.3733in}{0.9409in}{%

'N8ESDFB6.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}Consider this self-field for a
moment. When we studied charge, we found that charge created an electric
field. That electric field could make \emph{another} charge accelerate. But
the electric field crated by a charge does not make the charge that created
it accelerate. This is an instance of a self-field, an electric self-field.
Now with this background, let's return to our magnetic self-field.

Let's take Faraday's law and apply it to this circuit. Let me choose an area
vector $\mathbf{A}$ that is the area of the big loop and positive out of the
page. Again, let's use Kirchhoff's loop law. Let's find $\doint \mathbf{E}%
\cdot ds$ for the entire circuit. We can start with the battery. Since there
is an electric field inside the battery we will have a component of $%
\doint_{bat}\mathbf{E}\cdot ds$ as we cross it. The battery field goes from
positive to negative. If we go counter-clockwise, our $ds$ direction
traverses this from negative to positive, so the electric field is up and
the $ds$ direction is down, we have 
\begin{equation*}
\doint_{bat}\mathbf{E}\cdot ds=-\mathcal{E}_{bat}
\end{equation*}%
for this section of the circuit. Suppose we have ideal wires. If the wire
has no resistance, then it takes no work to move the charges through the
wire. In this case, an electron launched by the electric in the battery just
coasts from the battery to the resister. There is no need to have an
acceleration in the ideal wire. The electric potential won't change from the
battery to the resister. So there won't be a field in this ideal wire part.
But let's next we consider the resister. There is a potential change as we
go across it. And if there is a change in potential, there must be an
electric field. So the resister also has an electric field inside of it. We
have a component of $\doint_{R}\mathbf{E}\cdot ds$ that is equal to $%
\mathcal{E}_{R}=IR$ from this field. 
\begin{equation*}
\doint_{R}\mathbf{E}\cdot ds=IR
\end{equation*}%
Now we come to the big loop part. Since we have ideal wire, there is no
resistance in this part so there is no voltage drop for this part of the
circuit. All the energy that was given to the electrons by the battery was
lost in the resister. They just coast back to the other terminal of the
battery. Since there is no voltage drop in the big loop, 
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{E}_{\text{big loop}}=0
\end{equation*}%
there is no electric field in the big loop either. Along the big loop, $ds$
is certainly not zero. so 
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{E}_{\text{big loop}}=\doint_{\text{big loop}}\mathbf{E}\cdot ds=0
\end{equation*}

For the total loop we would have%
\begin{equation}
\doint \mathbf{E}\cdot ds=-\mathcal{E}_{batt}+IR+0
\end{equation}%
Normally, Kirchhoff's loop rule would say that all this must be zero, since
the sum of the energy changes around the loop must be zero if no energy is
lost. But now we know energy \emph{is} lost in making a magnetic field.

Consider the magnetic flux through the circuit. The magnetic field is made
by the current in the circuit. Note that we\ arranged the circuit so the
battery and resister are in a part that has very little area, so we can
ignore the flux through that part of the circuit. Most of the flux will go
through the big loop part. The magnetic field is out of the paper inside of
the loop. The flux is 
\begin{equation}
\Phi _{B}=\doint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{A}
\end{equation}%
and $\mathbf{B}$ and $\mathbf{A}$ are in the same direction. $\Phi _{B}$ is
positive.

Then from Biot-Savart%
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{B}=\frac{\mu _{o}I}{4\pi }\doint \frac{d\mathbf{s}\times \mathbf{%
\hat{r}}}{r^{2}}
\end{equation}%
Let me write this as 
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbf{B} &=&I\left( \frac{\mu _{o}}{4\pi }\doint \frac{d\mathbf{s}\times 
\mathbf{\hat{r}}}{r^{2}}\right) \\
&=&I\left( \text{geometry factor}\right)  \notag
\end{eqnarray}%
If the geometry of the situation does not change, then $B$ and $I$ are
proportional. Since $B\varpropto I,$ then $\Phi _{B}\varpropto I$ since the
integral in Biot-Savart is the surface integral of $\mathbf{B,}$ and $%
\mathbf{B}$ is everywhere proportional to $I.$ Instead of using Biot-Savart,
I\ wish to just define a constant of proportionality that will contain all
the geometric factors. I will simply say that 
\begin{equation}
\Phi _{B}=LI
\end{equation}%
where $L$ is my geometry factor. This geometry factor is just our
inductance! This is what inductance is. It is all the geometry factors that
make up our loop that will make the magnetic field if we put a current
through it.

Assuming I don't change the geometry, then the inductance won't change and
we have 
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\Phi _{B}}{dt}=L\frac{dI}{dt}
\end{equation}%
and Faraday's law gives us 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{E}=-\frac{d\Phi _{B}}{dt}=-L\frac{dI}{dt}
\end{equation}

Which says that we should not have expected $\doint \mathbf{E}\cdot ds=0$
for our case as we traverse the entire circuit. Integrating $\doint \mathbf{E%
}\cdot ds$ around the whole circuit including the big loop should not bring
us back to zero voltage. We have lost energy in making the field. Instead it
gives 
\begin{equation*}
\doint \mathbf{E}\cdot ds=-L\frac{dI}{dt}
\end{equation*}%
We are dealing with non-conservative fields. So we have some energy loss
like we would with a frictional force. It took some energy to make the
magnetic field!

With this insight, we can now make a Kirchhoff-like loop like rule for such
a situation. Integrating around the whole circuit gives%
\begin{equation*}
\doint \mathbf{E}\cdot ds=-\mathcal{E}_{bat}+\mathcal{E}_{R}
\end{equation*}%
Which we now realize should give $-L\frac{dI}{dt}$ so 
\begin{equation*}
\doint \mathbf{E}\cdot ds=-\mathcal{E}_{bat}+\mathcal{E}_{R}=-L\frac{dI}{dt}
\end{equation*}%
or more succinctly 
\begin{equation*}
-\mathcal{E}_{batt}+IR=-L\frac{dI}{dt}
\end{equation*}%
Now I\ can take the RHS to the left and find%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{E}_{batt}-IR-L\frac{dI}{dt}=0
\end{equation}%
which certainly \emph{looks} like Kirchhoff's rule with $-L\frac{dI}{dt}$
being a voltage drop across the single loop inductor. Under most conditions
we can just treat $-L\frac{dI}{dt}$ as a voltage drop and it works fine.
Most of the time thinking this way does not cause much of a problem. But
technically it is not right!

We should consider where our magnetic flux came from. The magnetic flux was
created by the current. It is a self-field. The current can't make a
magnetic flux that would then modify that current. This self-flux won't make
an electric field So there is no electric field in the big loop, so there is
no potential drop in that part of the circuit. It is just that $\doint 
\mathbf{E}\cdot ds\neq 0$ because our field is not conservative. We had to
take some energy to create the magnetic field.

Now, if you are doing simple circuit design, you can pretend you don't know
about Faraday's law and this complication and just treat $-L\frac{dI}{dt}$
as though it were a voltage drop. But really it is just that going around
the loop we should expect 
\begin{equation*}
\doint \mathbf{E}\cdot ds=-L\frac{dI}{dt}
\end{equation*}%
not%
\begin{equation*}
\doint \mathbf{E}\cdot ds=0
\end{equation*}%
The danger is that if you are designing a complicated device that depends on
there being an electric field in the inductor, your device will not work. We
have \emph{no external magnetic field,} our only magnetic field is the \emph{%
self-field} which will not produce an electric field (or at least will form
a very small electric field compared to the electric fields in the resistor
and the battery, due to the small resistance in the real wire we use to make
the big loop).

This is very subtile, and I struggle to remember this! Fortunately in most
circuit design it does not matter. We just treat the inductor as though it
were a true voltage drop.

I can make it even more exasperating by asking what you will see if you
place a voltmeter across the inductor. What I measure is a \textquotedblleft
voltage drop\textquotedblright\ of $LdI/dt,$ so maybe the there is a voltage
drop after all! But no, that is not right. The problem is that in
introducing the voltmeter, we have created a new loop. For this loop, the
field from our big loop \emph{is} an external field. .

The bottom line is that for non-conservative fields you need to be careful.
If you are just designing simple circuits, you can just treat $LdI/dt$ \emph{%
as though it were a voltage drop}, but you may be badly burned by this if
your system is more complicated, depending on the existence of a real
electric field. You can see that if you are designing complicated sensing
devices, you may need to deeply understand the underlying physics to get
them to work.

The equation we found from Faraday's law or incorrectly from Kirchhoff's
rule is%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{E}-IR-L\frac{dI}{dt}=0  \label{Potential Equation}
\end{equation}%
This is a differential equation. We can solve it for the current. To do so,
let's define a variable 
\begin{equation*}
x=\frac{\mathcal{E}}{R}-I
\end{equation*}%
and then we see that 
\begin{equation*}
dx=-dI
\end{equation*}%
Then we can write our differential equation as%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{\mathcal{E}}{R}-I-\frac{L}{R}\frac{dI}{dt} &=&0 \\
x+\frac{L}{R}\frac{dx}{dt} &=&0
\end{eqnarray*}%
and so%
\begin{equation*}
x=-\frac{L}{R}\frac{dx}{dt}
\end{equation*}%
You might be able to guess the solution at this point from your M316
experience. But let's work it out as a review. We see that our $x$ equation
separates into 
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dx}{x}=-\frac{R}{L}dt
\end{equation*}

Integration yields%
\begin{equation*}
\int_{x_{o}}^{x}\frac{dx}{x}=-\int_{0}^{t}\frac{R}{L}dt
\end{equation*}%
\begin{equation*}
\ln \left( \frac{x}{x_{o}}\right) =-\frac{R}{L}t
\end{equation*}%
exponentiating both sides gives%
\begin{equation*}
\left( \frac{x}{x_{o}}\right) =e^{-\frac{R}{L}t}
\end{equation*}%
Now we replace $x$ with $\frac{\mathcal{E}}{R}-I$%
\begin{equation*}
\left( \frac{\frac{\mathcal{E}}{R}-I}{\frac{\mathcal{E}}{R}-I_{o}}\right)
=e^{-\frac{R}{L}t}
\end{equation*}%
And because at $t=0$, $I=0$

\begin{equation*}
\left( \frac{\frac{\mathcal{E}}{R}-I}{\frac{\mathcal{E}}{R}}\right) =e^{-%
\frac{R}{L}t}
\end{equation*}%
rearranging gives

\begin{equation}
I=\frac{\mathcal{E}}{R}\left( 1-e^{-\frac{Rt}{L}}\right)
\end{equation}%
or, defining another time constant%
\begin{equation}
\tau =\frac{L}{R}
\end{equation}%
we have 
\begin{equation}
I=\frac{\mathcal{E}}{R}\left( 1-e^{-\frac{t}{\tau }}\right)
\end{equation}

We can see that 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathcal{E}}{R}=I_{\max }
\end{equation}%
comes from Ohm's law. So just like with our capacitor-resister circuit, we
have a current that grows in time, approaching the maximum value we get
after a time $t$ which is much longer than $\tau .$

You might expect that, like for a capacitor, there is an equation for an
inductor who has a maximum current flowing but for which the current source
is shorted (disconnected, and replaced with a resistanceless wire). The
equation is 
\begin{equation}
I=I_{o}e^{-\frac{t}{\tau }}
\end{equation}

\section{Magnetic Field Energy in Circuits}

We found last lecture that just like with a $RC$ circuit, we should expect
there to be energy stored in a $RL$ circuit. 
\begin{equation*}
U_{L}=\frac{1}{2}LI^{2}=\frac{1}{2}C\left( \Delta V\right) ^{2}
\end{equation*}%
Consider once again the $RL$ circuit shown below. \FRAME{dtbpF}{2.2719in}{%

'N8ESDGBA.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}} Recall that the current in the
right-hand loop decays exponentially with time according to the expression 
\begin{equation*}
I=I_{o}e^{-\frac{t}{\tau }}
\end{equation*}%
where $I_{o}=\mathcal{E}/R$ is the initial current in the circuit and $\tau
=L/R$ is the time constant. As an example problem, let's show that all the
energy initially stored in the magnetic field of the inductor appears as
internal energy in the resistor as the current decays to zero.

Recall that energy is delivered to the resister%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dU}{dt}=P=I^{2}R
\end{equation*}%
where $I$ is the instantaneous current.%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{dU}{dt} &=&I^{2}R \\
\frac{dU}{dt} &=&\left( I_{o}e^{-\frac{t}{\tau }}\right) ^{2}R \\
\frac{dU}{dt} &=&I_{o}^{2}e^{-2\frac{t}{\tau }}R
\end{eqnarray*}

To find the total energy delivered to the resister we integrate

\begin{equation*}
dU=I_{o}^{2}e^{-2\frac{t}{\tau }}Rdt
\end{equation*}%
\begin{equation*}
\int dU=\int_{0}^{\infty }I_{o}^{2}e^{-2\frac{t}{\tau }}Rdt
\end{equation*}%
\begin{equation*}
U=\int_{0}^{\infty }I_{o}^{2}e^{-2\frac{t}{\tau }}Rdt
\end{equation*}%
\begin{equation*}
U=I_{o}^{2}R\int_{0}^{\infty }e^{-2\frac{t}{\tau }}dt
\end{equation*}%
Use your calculator, or an integral table, or Maple, or Scientific Workplace
or your very good memory to recall that%
\begin{equation*}
\int e^{-ax}dx=-\frac{1}{a}e^{-ax}
\end{equation*}

If we let 
\begin{equation*}
a=-\frac{2}{\tau }
\end{equation*}%
then we can obtain%
\begin{equation*}
U=-\left. \frac{L}{2R}I_{o}^{2}Re^{-2\frac{t}{\tau }}\right\vert
_{0}^{\infty }
\end{equation*}%
\begin{equation*}
U=\frac{-L}{2}I_{o}^{2}\left( 0-1\right)
\end{equation*}%
\begin{equation}
U=\frac{1}{2}I_{o}^{2}L
\end{equation}

which is the initial energy stored in the magnetic field. All of the energy
that started in the inductor was delivered to the resistor.

\section{Mutual Induction}

Suppose we have two coils near each other. If either of the coils carries a
current, will there be an induced current in the other coil?\FRAME{dtbpF}{%

We define $\Phi _{12}$ as the flux through coil 2 due to the current in coil
1. Likewise if the battery is placed on coil $2$ we would have $\Phi _{21},$
the flux through coil 1 due to the current in coil 2.

We define the mutual inductance 
\begin{equation}
M_{12}=\frac{N_{2}\Phi _{12}}{I_{1}}
\end{equation}

BE CAREFUL! Not all books write the subscripts in the same order!

We can write the flux as%
\begin{equation*}
\Phi _{12}=\frac{M_{12}I_{1}}{N_{2}}
\end{equation*}
Then, using Faraday's law, we find the induced emf in coil 2%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathcal{E}_{2} &=&-N_{2}\frac{d\Phi _{B}}{dt} \\
&=&-N_{2}\frac{d}{dt}\left( \frac{M_{12}I_{1}}{N_{2}}\right) \\
&=&-M_{12}\frac{d}{dt}\left( I_{1}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}%
We state without proof the $M_{12}=M_{21}.$ Then%
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{E}_{2}=-M\frac{dI_{1}}{dt}
\end{equation*}

N_{B} $ turns. The handle has $N_{H}$ turns and completely covers the base
solenoid. What is the mutual inductance?

Solution:

The magnetic field in the base solenoid is%
\begin{equation*}
\doint \mathbf{B\cdot }d\mathbf{s=B}\boldsymbol{\ell =}\mu _{o}N_{B}I

or%
\begin{equation*}
B=\frac{\mu _{o}N_{B}I_{B}}{\ell }

\chapter{The Electromagnetic field}

We started off this semester saying we would consider the environment made
by a charge and how that environment affected a mover charge. Then we found
that moving charges are affected by the environment created by other moving
charges (currents). It is time to consider the overall environment created
by both electric and magnetic fields.

of the electromagnetic field. Which is manifest depends on our relative

\section{Relative motion and field theory}

Long ago in your study of physics we talked about relative motion when we
discussed moving objects and Doppler shift. We considered two reference
frames with a relative velocity $V\hat{\imath}.$ We called them frame $A$
and frame $B$ \FRAME{dtbpF}{3.367in}{1.2302in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special%

}We need to return to relative motion, considering what happens when there
are fields and charged particles involved. We will need to relabel our
diagram to avoid confusion because now $B$ will represent a magnetic field.
So let's call the two reference frames $S$ and $S^{\prime }.$ We will label
each axis with a prime in the $S^{\prime }$ frame.

Now let's assume we have a magnetic field in the region of space where our
two reference frames exist. Let's say that the magnetic field is stationary
in frame $S.$ This will be our environment. Let's also give a charge to the
person in frame $S^{\prime }$. This will be our mover charge.

\FRAME{dhF}{4.8544in}{2.7665in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language
"Scientific Word";type "GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio TRUE;display

'N8ESDHBF.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}Is there a force on the charge?

If we are with the person in reference frame $S,$ then we must say yes. The
charge is moving along with frame $S^{\prime }$ with a velocity $%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}=V\hat{\imath}$ so there will be a force 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}} &=&q\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}\times 
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}} \\
&=&qV\hat{\imath}\times B\left( -\hat{k}\right) \\
&=&qVB\hat{\jmath}
\end{eqnarray*}%
in the $\widehat{j}$ direction.

Now let's ride along with the person in frame $S^{\prime }.$ From this
frame, the charge looks stationary. So $v=0$ and 
\begin{equation*}
F=q\left( \mathbf{0}\right) \times \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}=0
\end{equation*}%
Both can't be true! So which is it? Is there a force on the charge or not?
Consider that the existence of a force is something we can test. A force
causes motion to change in ways we can detect. (the person in frame $%
S^{\prime }$ would \emph{feel} the pull on the charge he is holding). So
ultimately we can perform the experiment and see that there really is a
force. But where does the force come from?

Let's consider our fields. We have come to see fields as the source of
electric and magnetic forces. Electric forces come from electric fields
which come from environmental charges. Magnetic forces come from
environmental magnetic fields which come from moving charges.

And here is the difficulty, we are having trouble recognizing when the
charge is moving. We know from our consideration of relative motion that we
could view this situation as frame $S^{\prime }$ moving to the right with
frame $S$ stationary, or frame $S$ moving to the left with frame $S^{\prime
} $ stationary. There is no way to say that only one of these views is
correct. Both are equally valid.

\FRAME{dtbpF}{3.48in}{1.7677in}{0in}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

that person $S$ sees a moving charge. We have learned that moving charge
will make \emph{both} an electric field \emph{and} a magnetic field. This is
the situation from frame $S.$ But person $S^{\prime }$ sees a static charge.
This charge will \emph{only} make an electric field. We need a way to
resolve this apparent contradiction.

\subsection{Galilean transformation}

To resolve this difficulty, let's go back to forces. Here is our case of a
constant magnetic field that is stationary in frame $S$ with a charge in
frame $S^{\prime }$ again. \FRAME{dhF}{4.8544in}{2.7665in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{%

'N8ESDHBH.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}We can't see fields, but we can
see acceleration of a particle. Since by Newton's second law 
\begin{equation*}
F=ma
\end{equation*}%
we will know if there is an acceleration and therefore we will know if there
is a force! So are the forces and accelerations of a charged particle the
same in each frame? Let's find out.

Remember from Dynamics or PH121 that the speed of a particle transforms like
this%
\begin{eqnarray}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}^{\prime } &=&\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}-%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}_{S^{\prime }S} \\
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}} &=&\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}^{\prime }+%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}_{S^{\prime }S}  \notag
\end{eqnarray}%
where $V_{S^{\prime }S}$ is the relative speed between the two frames. What
this means is that if we have a particle moving with speed $v^{\prime }$ in
frame $S^{\prime }$ and we observe this particle in frame $S$ the speed of
that particle will seem to be $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}=\overrightarrow{%
\mathbf{v}}^{\prime }+\overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}_{S^{\prime }S}$. In our
case, $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}_{SS^{\prime }}=V_{x}\hat{\imath}$ so $%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}=\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}^{\prime }+V_{x}\hat{%
\imath}.$

A quick example might help. Suppose we have a person in the gym running on a
treadmill. \FRAME{dtbpF}{1.5973in}{1.094in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special%

is frame $S$. Then if we envision a reference frame riding along the
treadmill, that would be frame $S^{\prime }$. A person standing on the
treadmill in frame $S^{\prime }$ sees themselves as not moving, and the rest
of the room as moving the opposite direction. \FRAME{dtbpF}{2.5244in}{%

Now suppose the person is running at speed $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}%
^{\prime }=1.9\frac{\unit{m}}{\unit{s}}\hat{\imath}^{\prime }$ on the tread
mill in the tread mill frame $S^{\prime }$. \FRAME{dtbpF}{2.6403in}{1.9614in%

them.

}-2\frac{\unit{m}}{\unit{s}}\hat{\imath}=-0.1\frac{\unit{m}}{\unit{s}}\hat{%
\imath}
\end{equation*}%
since the $i$ and $\hat{\imath}^{\prime }$ directions are the same.

The person is going to fall off the end of the treadmill unless they pick up
the pace! This example just used the second equation in our transformation.%
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}=\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}^{\prime }+%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}_{S^{\prime }S}
\end{equation*}%
likewise, if we want to know how fast the person is walking with respect to
the treadmill frame, we take the room speed $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}=-0.1%
\frac{\unit{m}}{\unit{s}}\hat{\imath}$ and subtract from it the
treadmill/room relative speed $\overrightarrow{V}_{S^{\prime }S}=-2\frac{%
\unit{m}}{\unit{s}}\hat{\imath}$ to obtain%
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}^{\prime }=-0.1\frac{\unit{m}}{\unit{s}}\hat{%
\imath}-\left( -2\frac{\unit{m}}{\unit{s}}\hat{\imath}\right) =1.9\frac{%
\unit{m}}{\unit{s}}\hat{\imath}=1.9\frac{\unit{m}}{\unit{s}}\hat{\imath}%
^{\prime }
\end{equation*}

Armed with the Galilean transform, we can find the acceleration by taking a
derivative%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}^{\prime }}{dt} &=&\frac{d\overrightarrow{%
\mathbf{v}}}{dt}-\frac{d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}_{S^{\prime }S}}{dt} \\
\frac{d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}}{dt} &=&\frac{d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}%
^{\prime }}{dt}+\frac{d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}_{S^{\prime }S}}{dt}
\end{eqnarray*}%
then 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{a}}^{\prime } &=&\overrightarrow{\mathbf{a}}-\frac{d%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}_{S^{\prime }S}}{dt} \\
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{a}} &=&\overrightarrow{\mathbf{a}}^{\prime }+\frac{d%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}_{S^{\prime }S}}{dt}
\end{eqnarray*}%
but we will only consider constant relative motion\footnote{%
Accelerating reference frames are treated by General Relatively and are
treated with the notation of contravariant and covariant vectors, which are
beyond this course. They are taken up in a graduate level electricity and
magnetism course.}, so 
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}_{S^{\prime }S}}{dt}=0
\end{equation*}%
then both equations tell us 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{a}}^{\prime }=\overrightarrow{\mathbf{a}}
\end{equation*}%
so there \emph{must be a force }%
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}=m\overrightarrow{\mathbf{a}}=m\overrightarrow{%
\mathbf{a}}^{\prime }
\end{equation*}%
in both frame $S$ and $S^{\prime }.$

We can gain some insight into finding the mysterious missing force in frame $%
S^{\prime }$ by considering the net force in the case of both an electric
and a magnetic field%
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{net}=q_{m}\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}+q_{m}%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}\times \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}
\end{equation*}%
This was first written by Lorentz, so it is called the \emph{Lorentz force},
and is usually written as 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{net}=q_{m}\left( \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}+%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}\times \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}\right)
\end{equation*}%
Using this, let's consider the view point of each frame.

Going back to our two guys on different frames, In frame $S,$ the person
sees 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}} &=&q_{m}\left( 0+\overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}%
_{S^{\prime }S}\times \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}\right) =q_{m}V\hat{\imath}%
\times B\left( -\hat{k}\right) \\
&=&q_{m}VB\hat{\jmath}
\end{eqnarray*}%
and in frame $S^{\prime }$ the person sees 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}^{\prime }=q_{m}\left( \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}%
^{\prime }+0\times \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}^{\prime }\right) =q%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}^{\prime }
\end{equation*}%
It seems that the only way that $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}=\overrightarrow{%
\mathbf{F}}^{\prime }$ is that $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}^{\prime }\neq 0.$
So in frame $S^{\prime }$ our person must conclude that there is an external
electric field that produces the force $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}^{\prime
}.$ In frame $S$ the person is convinced that the magnetic field, $%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}\mathbf{,}$ is making the force. In frame $%
S^{\prime }$ the person is convinced that the electric field $%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}^{\prime }$ is making the force.

Our interpretation of this result is mind-blowing. It seems that whether we
see a magnetic field or an electric field depends on our reference frame!
The implication is that the electric and magnetic fields are not really two
different things. They are one field viewed from different reference frames!

So far we have been talking about external fields only. The field $%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}$ in our case study is created by some outside
agent. So the field $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}^{\prime }$ observed in
frame $S^{\prime }$ is also an environmental field. But the charge, itself,
creates a field. So the total electric field in frame $S^{\prime }$ is the
environmental field $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}^{\prime }$ plus the field
due to the charge, itself $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}_{\text{self}},$ or 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}_{tot}^{\prime } &=&\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}_{%
\text{self}}+\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}_{\text{environment}}^{\prime } \\
&=&\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}_{\text{self}}+\overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}%
_{S^{\prime }S}\times \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}_{\text{environment}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
which we usually just write as%
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}^{\prime }=\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}_{\text{self%
}}+\overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}_{S^{\prime }S}\times \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B%
}}_{\text{environment}}
\end{equation*}

We would predict that if we had a charge that is stationary in frame $S$ and
we rode along with frame $S^{\prime }$ that we would see a field 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}=\mathbf{E}_{\text{self}}^{\prime }-%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}_{S^{\prime }S}\times \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}%
_{\text{environment}}^{\prime }
\end{equation*}%
Of course, $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}_{\text{self}}$ can't create a force
on the charge, because it is a self-field. So we only need to be concerned
with $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}_{\text{self}}$ if we have other charges
that could move. We could actually have other charges riding along with
frame $S^{\prime }.$ In that case we would have an additional field $E_{%
\text{charge }}^{\prime }.$ We could write this as 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}=\mathbf{E}_{\text{charges in }S\prime }^{\prime
}-\overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}_{S^{\prime }S}\times \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}%
}_{\text{environment}}^{\prime }
\end{equation*}%
or just 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}=\mathbf{E}_{\text{charges}}^{\prime }-%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}_{S^{\prime }S}\times \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}%
_{\text{environment}}^{\prime }
\end{equation*}

What we have developed is important! We have an equation that let's us
determine the electric field in a frame, given the fields measured in
another frame.

We would expect that a similar thing would happen if we replaced the
magnetic fields with electric fields. Suppose we have an electric field in
the region of our frames and that this electric field is stationary with
respect to frame $S^{\prime }$ this time.

To see that this is true, let's examine the case where we have no external
fields, and we just have a charge moving along with frame $S^{\prime }.$
Then in frame $S^{\prime }$ we have the fields 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}^{\prime } &=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{q%
}{r^{2}}\mathbf{\hat{r}} \\
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}^{\prime } &=&0

\mathbf{B}}_{\text{environment}}^{\prime } \\
&=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{q}{r^{2}}\mathbf{\hat{r}}+%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}_{S^{\prime }S}\times \mathbf{0} \\
&=&\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{q}{r^{2}}\mathbf{\hat{r}}
\end{eqnarray*}

so 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}=\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}_{\text{ }}^{\prime }=%
\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{q}{r^{2}}\mathbf{\hat{r}}
\end{equation*}%
We see the same electric field due to the point charge being there in both
frames.

But in frame $S$ we are expecting the person to see a magnetic field because
to person $S$ the charge is moving. Using the Biot-Savart law%
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}=\frac{\mu _{o}}{4\pi }\frac{q\overrightarrow{%
\mathbf{v}}\times \mathbf{\hat{r}}}{r^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
since our charge is moving along with the $S^{\prime }$ frame $%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}=\overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}_{S^{\prime }S}$ so 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}=\frac{\mu _{o}}{4\pi }\frac{q}{r^{2}}\left( 
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}_{S^{\prime }S}\times \mathbf{\hat{r}}\right)
\end{equation*}%
but we can rewrite this by rearranging terms%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}} &=&\frac{\mu _{o}}{4\pi }\frac{q}{r^{2}}\left( 
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}_{S^{\prime }S}\times \mathbf{\hat{r}}\right) \\
&=&\left( \overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}_{S^{\prime }S}\times \frac{\mu _{o}}{%
4\pi }\frac{q}{r^{2}}\mathbf{\hat{r}}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}%
which looks vaguely familiar. Let's multiply top and bottom by $\epsilon
_{o} $%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}} &=&\left( \overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}_{S^{\prime
}S}\times \frac{\mu _{o}\epsilon _{o}}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{q}{r^{2}}%
\mathbf{\hat{r}}\right) \\
&=&\left( \overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}_{S^{\prime }S}\times \mu _{o}\epsilon
_{o}\left( \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon _{o}}\frac{q}{r^{2}}\mathbf{\hat{r}}%
\right) \right) \\
&=&\left( \overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}_{S^{\prime }S}\times \mu _{o}\epsilon
_{o}\left( \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}_{\text{ }}^{\prime }\right) \right) \\
&=&\mu _{o}\epsilon _{o}\left( \overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}_{S^{\prime
}S}\times \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}_{\text{ }}^{\prime }\right)
\end{eqnarray*}%
which is really quite astounding! Our $B$-fields have apparently always just
been due to moving electric fields after all!

Of course, we could have an additional magnet riding along with frame $%
S^{\prime }.$ To allow for that case, let's include a term $\overrightarrow{%
\mathbf{B}}_{\text{magnet}}^{\prime }$. 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}=\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}_{\text{magnets in }%
S^{\prime }}^{\prime }+\mu _{o}\epsilon _{o}\left( \overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}%
}_{S^{\prime }S}\times \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}_{\text{environment }%
}^{\prime }\right)
\end{equation*}%
or just 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}=\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}_{\text{magnets}%
}^{\prime }+\mu _{o}\epsilon _{o}\left( \overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}%
_{S^{\prime }S}\times \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}_{\text{environment }%
}^{\prime }\right)
\end{equation*}%
and we would expect that if we worked this problem from the other frame's
point of view we would likewise find 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}^{\prime }=\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}_{\text{%
magnet}}-\mu _{o}\epsilon _{o}\left( \overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}_{S^{\prime
}S}\times \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}_{\text{environment}}\right)
\end{equation*}%
where the minus sign comes from the relative velocity being in the other
direction. Again $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}_{\text{magnet}}$ is a
self-field. It won't move itself, but might be important if we have a second
magnet in our experiment. Then $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}_{\text{magnet}}$
would cause a force on this second magnet.

Once again we have found a way to find a field, the magnetic field this
time, in one frame if we know the fields on another frame! We call this sort
of equation a \emph{transformation.}

We should take a moment to look at the constants $\mu _{o}\epsilon _{o}.$
Let's put in their values%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mu _{o}\epsilon _{o} &=&\left( 8.85\times 10^{-12}\frac{\unit{C}^{2}}{\unit{%
N}\unit{m}^{2}}\right) \left( 4\pi \times 10^{-7}\frac{\unit{T}\unit{m}}{%
\unit{A}}\right) \\
&=&1.\,\allowbreak 112\,1\times 10^{-17}\frac{\unit{s}^{2}}{\unit{m}^{2}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
This is a very small number, and it may not appear to be interesting. We can
see that the additional magnetic fields due to the movement of the charges
can be quite small unless the electric field is large or the relative speed
is large (or both). So much of the time this additional field due to the
moving charge is negligible. But let's calculate%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu _{o}\epsilon _{o}}} &=&\frac{1}{\sqrt{\left( 8.85\times
10^{-12}\frac{\unit{C}^{2}}{\unit{N}\unit{m}^{2}}\right) \left( 4\pi \times
10^{-7}\frac{\unit{T}\unit{m}}{\unit{A}}\right) }} \\
&=&2.\,\allowbreak 998\,6\times 10^{8}\allowbreak \frac{\unit{m}}{\unit{s}}
\\
&=&c
\end{eqnarray*}%
This is the speed of light! It even has units of $\unit{m}/\unit{s}.$ This
seems an amazing coincidence--too amazing. And this was one of the clues
that Maxwell used to discover that light is a wave in what we will now call
(because they are different aspects of one thing) the \emph{electromagnetic
field}.

We can write the transformation equations for the fields as 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}^{\prime } &=&\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}_{\text{%
charges}}+\overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}_{S^{\prime }S}\times \overrightarrow{%
\mathbf{B}}_{\text{environment}} \\
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}^{\prime } &=&\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}_{\text{%
magnet}}-\frac{1}{c^{2}}\left( \overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}_{S^{\prime
}S}\times \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}_{\text{environment}}\right) \\
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}} &=&\mathbf{E}_{\text{charges}}^{\prime }-%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}_{S^{\prime }S}\times \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}%
_{\text{environment}}^{\prime } \\
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}} &=&\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}_{\text{magnet}%
}^{\prime }+\frac{1}{c^{2}}\left( \overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}_{S^{\prime
}S}\times \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}_{\text{ environment}}^{\prime }\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

Let's do a problem. Suppose we have a metal loop moving into an area where
there is a magnetic field as shown. Let's show that there is a force on
charges in this loop no matter what frame we consider. First, lets consider
the frame where the magnetic field is stationary and the loop moves.\FRAME{%

There should be an upward force on the positive charge because the charge is
moving in a magnetic field. Let's say that \textquotedblleft
up\textquotedblright\ is the $\hat{\jmath}$ direction and that
\textquotedblleft to the right\textquotedblright\ is the $\hat{\imath}$
direction. Then The Lorentz force is 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}} &=&q\left( \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}+%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}\times \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}\right) \\
&=&q\left( \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}+\overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}%
_{S^{\prime }S}\times \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}%
Now $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}_{S^{\prime }S}$ means the speed of the
reference frame $S^{\prime }$ with respect to frame $S.$ That is $+V\hat{%
\imath}.$ And there is no electric field in frame $S,$ so 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}} &=&q\left( \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}+%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}_{S^{\prime }S}\times \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}%
\right) \\
&=&q\left( 0+V\hat{\imath}\times B\left( -\hat{k}\right) \right) \\
&=&q\left( V\hat{\imath}\times \mathbf{B}\left( -\hat{k}\right) \right) \\
&=&qVB\hat{\jmath}
\end{eqnarray*}%
Now suppose we change reference frames so we are riding along with the loop
in frame, $S^{\prime }.$ In this frame, the loop is not moving, and the
magnetic field is moving by us the opposite direction. We'll call this the
\textquotedblleft prime frame.\textquotedblright\ We should get the same
force if we change frames to ride along with the loop. \FRAME{dtbpF}{3.9763in%

find the $E$ and $B$-fields in the new reference frame. Then 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}^{\prime } &=&\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}_{\text{%
self-charge}}+\overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}_{S^{\prime }S}\times 
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}_{\text{environment}} \\
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}^{\prime } &=&\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}_{\text{%
magnet}}-\frac{1}{c^{2}}\left( \overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}_{S^{\prime
}S}\times \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}_{\text{environment}}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}%
so in the prime frame we have an electric field%
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}^{\prime }=\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}_{\text{%
charges}}+\overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}_{S^{\prime }S}\times \overrightarrow{%
\mathbf{B}}_{\text{environment}}
\end{equation*}%
and in particular, we have an external field%
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}_{\text{environment}}^{\prime }=\overrightarrow{%
\mathbf{V}}_{S^{\prime }S}\times \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}_{\text{%
environment}}
\end{equation*}%
(we left off the $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}_{\text{charge}}$ because it
can't move the charge that made it, so it is not part of the force).

Note that $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}_{S^{\prime }S}$ is the speed of the
primed frame as viewed from the unprimed frame. So $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{V%
}}_{S^{\prime }S}=+V\hat{\imath}$ 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}^{\prime } &=&V\left( \hat{\imath}\right) \times
B\left( -\hat{k}\right) \\
&=&VB\hat{\jmath}
\end{eqnarray*}%
That is our electric field in the primed frame.

The magnetic field in the primed frame is given by 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}^{\prime }=\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}_{\text{%
magnet}}-\frac{1}{c^{2}}\left( \overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}_{S^{\prime
}S}\times \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}_{\text{environment}}\right)
\end{equation*}%
but there is no external electric field in the unprimed frame, so 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}^{\prime } &=&\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}_{\text{%
magnet}}-\frac{1}{c^{2}}\left( \overrightarrow{\mathbf{V}}_{S^{\prime
}S}\times 0\right) \\
&=&\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}_{\text{magnet}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
where here \textquotedblleft magnet\textquotedblright\ means what ever is
making the magnetic field in the unprimed frame. Something must be there
making the field, and it is not our charge. It could be an electromagnet, or
a permanent magnet, we have not been told). But it is not our charge, so we
know $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}_{\text{magnet}}$ must be there and can act
on our charge. So 
\begin{equation*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}^{\prime }=\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}
\end{equation*}%
The magnetic field in the primed frame is just the same as the magnetic
field we see in the unprimed frame. Then in the primed frame the Lorentz
force is 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}^{\prime } &=&q\left( \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}%
^{\prime }+\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}\times \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}%
^{\prime }\right) \\
&=&q\left( VB\hat{\jmath}+\mathbf{0}\times \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}\right)
\\
&=&qVB\hat{\jmath}
\end{eqnarray*}%
Which is exactly the same force (magnitude and direction) as we got in the
unprimed frame.

\section{Field Laws}

A \textquotedblleft law\textquotedblright\ in physics is a mathematical
statement of a physical principal or theory. We have been collecting laws
for what we will now call the \emph{electromagnetic field theory}. Let's
review:

\subsection{Gauss' law}

\FRAME{dhF}{2.8245in}{2.4249in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

We found that the electric flux through an imaginary closed surface that
incloses some charge is%
\begin{equation*}
\Phi _{E}=\oint \mathbf{E}\times d\mathbf{A}=\frac{Q_{in}}{\epsilon _{o}}
\end{equation*}%
We called this Gauss' law.

But consider the situation with a magnet.%
%TCIMACRO{%

We can define a magnetic flux just like we defined the electric flux. And
now we know they must be related. Is there a Gauss' law for magnetism? Let's
consider the magnetic flux. 
\begin{equation*}
\Phi _{B}=\oint \mathbf{B}\times d\mathbf{A}
\end{equation*}%
This should be proportional to the number of \textquotedblleft magnetic
charges\textquotedblright\ inclosed in the surface.\ \FRAME{dhF}{3.3501in}{%

that leaves comes back in. That is how we defined zero net flux, so 
\begin{equation*}
\Phi _{B}=\oint \mathbf{B}\times d\mathbf{A}=0
\end{equation*}%
Which would tell us that there are no free \textquotedblleft magnetic
charges\textquotedblright\ or no single magnetic poles. A single magnetic
pole is called a \emph{monopole} and indeed we have never discovered one.
These two forms of Gauss' law form the first two of our electromagnetic
field equations.

The differences between them have to do with the fact that magnetic fields
are due to moving charges.

We have a third electromagnetic field law, Ampere's law. We found Ampere's
law by integrating around a closed loop with a current penetrating the loop. 
\begin{equation*}
\oint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{s}=\mu _{o}I_{through}
\end{equation*}

We also know Faraday's law%
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{E}=\oint \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{s}=-\frac{d\Phi _{B}}{dt}
\end{equation*}%
which told us that changing magnetic fields created an electric field. We
have found that the opposite must be true, that a changing electric field
must create a magnetic field. We express this as 
\begin{equation*}
\oint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{s}\propto \frac{d\Phi _{E}}{dt}
\end{equation*}%
Which gives two expressions for $\oint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{s}$. But we
have yet to show that this equation is true. That is the subject of our next
lecture. If we can accomplish this, we will have a complete set of field
equations that describe how the electromagnetic field works. In the
following lecture we will complete the set of field equations, and then in
the next lecture we will show that we get electromagnetic waves from these
equations.

\chapter{Field Equations and Waves in the Field}

We started this class with a study of waves. We learned about optics, and
finally electromagnetic field theory. In this lecture we will take on a case
study that involves all three. We will have come full circle and in the
process, hopefully understand all three topics a little better.

\begin{itemize}
\item Changing electric fields produce magnetic fields

\item A changing electric flux is described as a displacement current $%
I_{d}=\varepsilon _{o}\frac{d\Phi _{E}}{dt}$

\item The complete version of Ampere's law is $\doint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\ell
=\mu _{o}\left( I+I_{d}\right) $

\item Maxwell's equations give a complete classical picture of
electromagnetic fields

\item Maxwell's equations plus the Lorentz force describe all of
electrodynamics.

\item Maxwell's equation lead directly to the liner wave equation for both
the electric and the magnetic field with the speed of light being the speed
of the waves.

\item The magnitude of the $E$ and $B$ fields are related in an
electromagnetic wave by $E_{\max }=cB_{\max }$
\end{itemize}

\section{Displacement Current}

Last time we listed Ampere's law as one of the basic field equations. But we
did not discuss it at all. That is because we were saving it for our
discussion in this lecture We need to look deeply into Ampere's law. Here is
what we have for Ampere's law so far%
\begin{equation*}
\oint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{s}=\mu _{o}I_{through}
\end{equation*}%
To see why we need to consider it further, let's do a hard problem with
Ampere's law. Let's set up a circuit with a battery a switch and a circular
plate capacitor in the wire. \FRAME{dtbpF}{1.4918in}{0.9608in}{0pt}{}{}{%

using the Biot-Savart equation, but that would be hard. I don't know how to

circular surface.\FRAME{dtbpF}{1.7815in}{1.1243in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special%

of the page. We also know that for a long straight wire, the field magnitude
does not change as we go around the wire, so we can write our integral as 
\begin{equation*}
\doint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\ell =B\doint d\ell =B2\pi r=\mu _{o}I
\end{equation*}%
so 
\begin{equation*}
B2\pi r=\mu _{o}I
\end{equation*}%
so the field is 
\begin{equation*}
B=\frac{\mu _{o}I}{2\pi r}
\end{equation*}%
which is very familiar, just the equation for a field from a long straight
wire.

but think about what the current does at the plate. It would be very hard to
do the integration!. So again let's try Ampere's law. If we use the same
size surface 
\begin{equation*}
\doint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\ell =B\doint d\ell =B2\pi r
\end{equation*}%
but this is equal to $\mu _{o}I_{through}.$ There is no $I$ going through
the capacitor! so 
\begin{equation}
B2\pi r=0

infinitely long. And even if they were, would we really expect the field to

surface, but it does not say it has to be a circular surface. In fact, we
could use the strange surface labeled $S_{2}$ in the figure above. This is a
perfectly good surface to associate with the loop at $P_{1}.$ So this gives
us 
\begin{equation*}
\doint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\ell =\mu _{o}I=0

at $P_{1}$! So we have two different results with Ampere's law for the same

the plates can be considered to be very big the field is approximately 
\begin{equation*}
E=\frac{\eta }{\varepsilon _{o}}=\frac{Q}{\pi R^{2}\varepsilon _{o}}
\end{equation*}%
but we know that the charge is changing in time once the switch is thrown.
We can find the rate of change of the field, then%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dE}{dt}=\frac{1}{\pi R^{2}\varepsilon _{o}}\frac{dQ}{dt}
\end{equation*}

By definition%
\begin{equation*}
I=\frac{dQ}{dt}
\end{equation*}%
is a current, but what current? It must be the current that is supplying the
charge to the capacitor. That current is what is changing the $Q$ in the
capacitor, and it is the $Q$ separation that is making the field. So the
time derivative of the electric field is 
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dE}{dt}=\frac{I}{\pi R^{2}\varepsilon _{o}}
\end{equation*}%
where $I$ is the current in the wire, and only if the wire current is zero
will there be no change in the electric field.

This gives us an idea. A changing electric field creates a magnetic field.
Suppose this changing electric field created a magnetic field like the
current does? It would be as though there were a current with a value%
\begin{equation}
I_{d}=\pi R^{2}\varepsilon _{o}\frac{dE}{dt}
\end{equation}%
Note that in this we have the area of the plate, $A_{plate}=\pi R^{2}$
multiplied by the time rate of change of the electric field. Also note, that
in our approximation for our capacitor, there is only an electric field
inside the plates. So, remembering electric flux,%
\begin{equation*}
\Phi _{E}=\int \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{A}
\end{equation*}%
our flux though the surface at $P_{2}$ would be%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Phi _{E} &=&EA \\
&=&\pi R^{2}E
\end{eqnarray*}%
so we can identify 
\begin{equation*}
\pi R^{2}dE=A_{plate}dE=d\Phi _{E}
\end{equation*}%
as a small amount of \emph{electric} flux. Then our equivalent current will
be%
\begin{equation}
I_{d}=\varepsilon _{o}\frac{d\Phi _{E}}{dt}
\end{equation}%
Maxwell decided that, since this looked like equivalent to a current, he
would call it a current and include it in Ampere's law.%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\doint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\ell &=&\mu _{o}\left( I+I_{d}\right) \\
&=&\mu _{o}\left( I+\varepsilon _{o}\frac{d\Phi _{E}}{dt}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}%
but remember it is not really a current. What we have is a changing electric
field that is making a magnetic field \emph{as though there were a current }$%
I_{d}.$

We can try this on or capacitor problem. We have done our capacitor problem
for $S_{1}$ where we expect $\frac{d\Phi _{E}}{dt}\approx 0$ so our original
calculation stands 
\begin{equation*}
B_{S_{1}}=\frac{\mu _{o}I}{2\pi r}
\end{equation*}%
but now we know that if we use $S_{2}$ we have $\frac{d\Phi _{E}}{dt}\neq 0$%
, and we realize that at $P_{2}$ the current $I=0$ so 
\begin{equation*}
\doint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\ell =\mu _{o}\left( 0+\varepsilon _{o}\frac{d\Phi
_{E}}{dt}\right)
\end{equation*}%
and for our geometry we found$\frac{d\Phi _{E}}{dt}$ 
\begin{equation*}
\doint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\ell =\mu _{o}\left( 0+\pi R^{2}\varepsilon _{o}%
\frac{dE}{dt}\right)
\end{equation*}%
and we calculated $\frac{dE}{dt}$ so we can substitute it in%
\begin{equation*}
\doint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\ell =\mu _{o}\left( 0+\pi R^{2}\varepsilon _{o}%
\frac{I}{\pi R^{2}\varepsilon _{o}}\right)
\end{equation*}%
where we remember that the current $I$ is the current making the electric
field--the current in the wire. Then we have 
\begin{equation*}
B2\pi r=\mu _{o}\left( 0+I\right)
\end{equation*}%
and our field is%
\begin{equation*}
B=\frac{\mu _{o}I}{2\pi r}
\end{equation*}%
which is just what we found using $S_{1}.$ Maxwell seems to have saved the
day! There is no dip in the magnetic field magnitude.

There is one more fix we will have to do to Ampere's law eventually. We
found this form of Ampere's law with the capacitor empty--not even
containing air. But we could do the same derivation with a dielectric filled
capacitor. We also could have magnetic materials involved.

But what we have done so far is really a momentous result. We have shown
that, indeed, we should have an equation that provides symmetry with
Faraday's law. We suspected that%
\begin{equation*}
\oint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{s}\propto \frac{d\Phi _{E}}{dt}
\end{equation*}%
and we can write the constants of proportionality as 
\begin{equation*}
\oint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{s}=\mu _{o}\epsilon _{o}\frac{d\Phi _{E}}{dt}
\end{equation*}%
but because we have $\oint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{s}$ also in Ampere's
law, we can combine the two to yield 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\doint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{s} &=&\mu _{o}\left( I+I_{d}\right) \\
&=&\mu _{o}\left( I+\varepsilon _{o}\frac{d\Phi _{E}}{dt}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

This is the last of our field equations. It is called the Maxwell-Ampere law.

Let's use this to solve for the magnetic field inside the capacitor. A
changing electric field will make a magnetic field.

Take a surface inside the plates that is a circle of radius $r<R.$ Then%
\begin{equation*}
\doint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{s=}B2\pi r
\end{equation*}%
and from our modified Ampere's equation%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\doint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{s} &=&\mu _{o}\left( I+I_{d}\right) \\
&=&\mu _{o}\left( I+\varepsilon _{o}\frac{d\Phi _{E}}{dt}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}%
so 
\begin{eqnarray*}
B2\pi r &=&\mu _{o}\left( 0+\varepsilon _{o}\frac{d\Phi _{E}}{dt}\right) \\
&=&\pi r^{2}\mu _{o}\varepsilon _{o}\frac{dE}{dt} \\
&=&\pi r^{2}\mu _{o}\varepsilon _{o}\frac{I}{\pi R^{2}\varepsilon _{o}} \\
&=&\mu _{o}\frac{r^{2}I}{R^{2}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
so%
\begin{equation}
B=\mu _{o}\frac{rI}{2\pi R^{2}}
\end{equation}

We should pause to realize what we have just done. We have shown that,
indeed, a changing electric field can produce a magnetic field. This
statement is a profound look at the way the universe works!

\section{Maxwell Equations}

We have developed a powerful set of understanding equations for electricity
and magnetism. Maxwell summarized our knowledge in a series of four equations%
\begin{equation}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
$\doint \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{A=}\frac{Q_{in}}{\varepsilon _{o}}$ & 
Gauss's law for electric fields \\ 
$\doint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{A}=0$ & Gauss's law for magnetic fields \\ 
$\doint \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{s=}-\frac{d\Phi _{B}}{dt}$ & Faraday's law
\\ 
$\doint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{s=\mu }_{o}I+\varepsilon _{o}\mu _{o}\frac{%
d\Phi _{E}}{dt}$ & Ampere-Maxwell Law%
\end{tabular}%
\end{equation}%
If we have a dielectric, we might see these written as\cite{lewin2002}

\begin{equation}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
$\doint \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{A=}\frac{Q_{in}}{\varepsilon _{o}\kappa }$
& Gauss's law for electric fields \\ 
$\doint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{A=}0$ & Gauss's law for magnetic fields \\ 
$\doint \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{s=}-\frac{d\Phi _{B}}{dt}$ & Faraday's law
\\ 
$\doint \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{s=}\mu _{o}\kappa _{m}\left( I+\varepsilon
_{o}\kappa \frac{d\Phi _{E}}{dt}\right) $ & Ampere-Maxwell Law%
\end{tabular}%
\end{equation}

Since we have all had multivariate calculus, we may also see these written as%
\begin{equation}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
$\mathbf{\nabla }\cdot \mathbf{E}=\frac{\rho }{\varepsilon _{o}}$ & Gauss's
law for electric fields \\ 
$\mathbf{\nabla }\cdot \mathbf{B}=0$ & Gauss's law for magnetic fields \\ 
$\mathbf{\nabla }\times \mathbf{E=}-\frac{d\mathbf{B}}{dt}$ & Faraday's law
\\ 
$c^{2}\mathbf{\nabla }\times \mathbf{B=}\frac{\mathbf{J}}{\varepsilon _{o}}+%
\frac{d\mathbf{E}}{dt}$ & Ampere-Maxwell Law%
\end{tabular}%
\end{equation}%
I'll let you remember the process to do the translation from $\doint \mathbf{%
B}\cdot d\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{\nabla }\cdot \mathbf{B.}$

But we are familiar with all of these equations now. These four equations
are the basis of all of classical electrodynamics. In an electromagnetic
problem, we find the fields using the Maxwell equations to find the fields,
and then apply the fields to find the Lorentz forces%
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{F}=q\mathbf{E}+q\mathbf{v}\times \mathbf{B}
\end{equation}

It turns out that these four equations strongly imply that there can be
waves in the fields. We will see this in our next lecture. We already know
from our study of optics that these waves are what we call light.

\chapter{Electromagnetic waves}

\section{Turning the Maxwell Equations into Differential Equations}

Maxwell took the hint that $\mu _{o}\epsilon _{o}$ was related to $c,$ the
speed of light and he thought that light might be a wave in the
electromagnetic field. We know about waves. We can describe a wave by
looking for a surface of constant amplitude--a wave crest. A point source
will cause spherical surfaces of constant amplitude. A half-wave antenna
makes a toroidal shaped wave front. We will not deal with spherical or worse
wave shapes. Unfortunately, many antennas send out complicated wave patterns
that take spherical harmonics to describe well. That is beyond the math we
want to do in this course.\FRAME{dhFU}{4.1572in}{2.0851in}{0pt}{\Qcb{A

infinite extent. Image is public domain.}}{\Qlb{Planewave}}{Figure}{\special%

Instead, let's picture our wave front far from the source. No matter what
the total shape, if we look at a small patch of the fields far away, they
will look like the plane wave in the last figure. Since this is a useful and
common situation (except if you use lasers), we will perform some
calculations assuming plane wave geometry.

We will assume we are in empty space, so the charge $q$ and current $I$ will
both be zero. Then our Maxwell Equations become%
\begin{equation}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
$\doint \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{A}}=0$ & 
Gauss's law for electric fields \\ 
$\doint \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{A}}=0$ & 
Gauss's law for magnetic fields \\ 
$\doint \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}=-\frac{%
d\Phi _{B}}{dt}$ & Faraday's law \\ 
$\doint \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}%
=\varepsilon _{o}\mu _{o}\frac{d\Phi _{E}}{dt}$ & Ampere-Maxwell Law%
\end{tabular}%
\end{equation}

Our goal is to show that these equations tell us that we can have waves in
the field. To do this, we will show that Maxwell's equations really contain
the linear wave equation within them. As a reminder, here is the linear wave
equation%

it is a second order differential equation where the left side derivatives
are take with respect to position, and the right side derivatives are taken
with respect to time. The quantity, $v,$ is the wave speed. In this form of
the equation $y$ is the displacement of a medium. Our medium will be the
electromagnetic field.

Let's start with Faraday's law%
\begin{equation}
\doint \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}=-\frac{%
d\Phi _{B}}{dt}
\end{equation}%
Given our geometry, we can say the wave is traveling in the $x$ direction
with the $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}$ field positive in the $y$ direction
and the magnetic field is positive in the $z$ direction.\FRAME{dhF}{3.681in}{%

'N8ESDJBY.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}The top and bottom of the
rectangle don't contribute because $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot d%
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}=\mathbf{0}$ along these paths. On the sides, the
field is either in the $d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}$ or it is in the
opposite direction. So 
\begin{equation*}
\doint \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}=\doint
Eds
\end{equation*}%
or 
\begin{equation*}
\doint \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}=-\doint
Eds
\end{equation*}%
along the sides. Let's say we travel counter-clockwise along the loop. Then
the left side will be negative and the right side will be positive.

\begin{equation*}
\doint \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}%
=\int_{right}Eds-\int_{left}Eds
\end{equation*}%
On the left side, we are at a position $x$ away from the axis, and on the
right side we are a position $x+\Delta x$ away from the axis. Then the field
of the left side is $E\left( x,t\right) $ and the field on the right hand
side is approximately 
\begin{equation}
E\left( x+\Delta x,t\right) \approx E\left( x,t\right) +\frac{\partial E}{%
\partial x}\Delta x
\end{equation}%
so if our loop is small, then $\ell $ is small and $E$ won't change much so
we can write approximately 
\begin{eqnarray}
\doint \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}
&=&\int_{right}Eds-\int_{left}Eds \\
&\approx &E\left( x+\Delta x,t\right) \ell -E\left( x,t\right) \ell \\
&=&\left( E\left( x,t\right) +\frac{\partial E}{\partial x}\Delta x\right)
\ell -E\left( x,t\right) \ell  \notag \\
&=&\left( E\left( x,t\right) +\frac{\partial E}{\partial x}\Delta x\right)
\ell -E\left( x,t\right) \ell  \notag \\
&=&\ell \frac{\partial E}{\partial x}\Delta x
\end{eqnarray}%
So far then, Faraday's law \footnote{%
We need $ds$ to be very small, much smaller than the wavelength of the wave.}
\begin{equation*}
\doint \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}=-\frac{%
d\Phi _{B}}{dt}
\end{equation*}%
becomes%
\begin{equation*}
\ell \frac{\partial E}{\partial x}\Delta x=-\frac{d\Phi _{B}}{dt}
\end{equation*}%
Let's move on to the right hand side of Faraday's law. We need to find $\Phi
_{B}$ so that we can find the time rate of change of the flux. We can say
that $B$ is nearly constant over such a small area, so 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Phi _{B} &=&\mathbf{B}\cdot \mathbf{A} \\
&=&BA\cos \theta \\
&=&BA \\
&=&B\ell \Delta x
\end{eqnarray*}%
where here $\Delta x$ means \textquotedblleft a small
distance\textquotedblright\ as it did above. Then 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{d\Phi _{B}}{dt} &=&\frac{d}{dt}\left( B\ell \Delta x\right) \\
&=&\ell \Delta x\left. \frac{dB}{dt}\right\vert _{x\text{ constant}} \\
&=&\ell \Delta x\frac{\partial B}{\partial t}
\end{eqnarray*}%
where we have held $x$ constant because we are not changing our small area,
so Faraday's law%
\begin{equation*}
\doint \overrightarrow{\mathbf{E}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}=-\frac{%
d\Phi _{B}}{dt}
\end{equation*}%
becomes%
\begin{eqnarray}
\ell \frac{\partial E}{\partial x}\Delta x &\mathbf{=}&-\ell \Delta x\frac{%
\partial B}{\partial t}  \notag \\
\frac{\partial E}{\partial x} &\mathbf{=}&-\frac{\partial B}{\partial t}
\end{eqnarray}%
We have made some progress, we have a differential equation relating the
fields, but it is a mixed equation containing both the electric and magnetic
fields. We are only half way there.

\subsection{Rewriting of the Maxwell-Ampere Law}

We have used one field equation so far and that took us part of the way. We
have the Maxwell-Ampere law as well. We can use this to modify our result
from Faraday's law to find the linear wave equation that we expect. The
Maxwell-Ampere law with no sources (charges or currents) states 
\begin{equation*}
\doint \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}%
=\varepsilon _{o}\mu _{o}\frac{d\Phi _{E}}{dt}
\end{equation*}%
This time we must consider the magnetic field path integral\FRAME{dhF}{%
2.0271in}{2.1906in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language "Scientific
Word";type "GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio TRUE;display "USEDEF";valid_file

"1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename 'N8ESDKBZ.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}%
We can do the same thing we did with Faraday's law with an area, but this
time we will use the area within the magnetic field (shown in the figure
above). Again, let's start with the left hand side of the equation. We see
that the sides of our area that are parallel to the $x$-axis do not matter
because $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}=0$
along these sides, but the other two are in the direction (or opposite
direction) of the field. They do contribute to the line integral.%
\begin{eqnarray}
\doint \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}
&=&B\left( x,t\right) \ell -B\left( x+\Delta x,t\right) \ell \\
&\approx &-\ell \frac{\partial B}{\partial x}\Delta x  \notag
\end{eqnarray}

Now for the left hand side, we need the electric flux. For such a small
area, the field is nearly constant so%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Phi _{E} &\approx &EA\cos \theta \\
&=&EA \\
&=&E\ell \Delta x
\end{eqnarray*}%
so 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \Phi _{E}}{\partial t}=\ell \Delta x\frac{\partial E}{%
\partial t}
\end{equation}%
Combining both sides%
\begin{eqnarray}
\doint \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}\cdot d\overrightarrow{\mathbf{s}}
&=&\varepsilon _{o}\mu _{o}\frac{d\Phi _{E}}{dt}  \notag \\
-\ell \frac{\partial B}{\partial x}\Delta x &=&\varepsilon _{o}\mu _{o}\ell
\Delta dx\frac{\partial E}{\partial t}  \notag \\
\frac{\partial B}{\partial x} &=&-\varepsilon _{o}\mu _{o}\frac{\partial E}{%
\partial t}
\end{eqnarray}%
We now have a second differential equation relating $B$ and $E.$ But it is
also a mixed differential equation.

\section{Wave equation for plane waves}

This leaves us with two equations to work with

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial E}{\partial x}\mathbf{=}-\frac{\partial B}{\partial t}
\end{equation}%
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial B}{\partial x}=-\varepsilon _{o}\mu _{o}\frac{\partial E}{%
\partial t}
\end{equation}%
Remember that these are all partial derivatives. Taking the derivative of
the first equation with respect to $x$ gives%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{\partial }{\partial x}\frac{\partial E}{\partial x} &\mathbf{=}&\frac{%
\partial }{\partial x}\left( -\frac{\partial B}{\partial t}\right) \\
\frac{\partial ^{2}E}{\partial x^{2}} &\mathbf{=}&-\frac{\partial }{\partial
x}\left( \frac{\partial }{\partial t}B\right) \\
\frac{\partial ^{2}E}{\partial x^{2}} &\mathbf{=}&-\frac{\partial }{\partial
t}\left( \frac{\partial B}{\partial x}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}%
In the last equation we swapped the order of differentiation for the right
hand side. In parenthesis, we have $\partial B/\partial x$ on the right hand
side. But we know what $\partial B/\partial x$ is from our second equation.
We substitute from our second equation to obtain%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial ^{2}E}{\partial x^{2}}\mathbf{=}-\frac{\partial }{\partial t}%
\left( -\varepsilon _{o}\mu _{o}\frac{\partial E}{\partial t}\right)
\end{equation*}%
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial ^{2}E}{\partial x^{2}}\mathbf{=}\varepsilon _{o}\mu _{o}\frac{%
\partial ^{2}E}{\partial t^{2}}
\end{equation}%
We can do the same thing, but taking derivatives with respect to time to give%
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial ^{2}B}{\partial x^{2}}\mathbf{=}\varepsilon _{o}\mu _{o}\frac{%
\partial ^{2}B}{\partial t^{2}}
\end{equation}

You will recognize both of these last equations as being in the form of the
linear wave equation. 
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial ^{2}y}{\partial x^{2}}\mathbf{=}\frac{1}{v^{2}}\frac{\partial
^{2}y}{\partial t^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
This means that both the $E$ field and the $B$ field are governed by the
linear wave equation with the speed of the waves given by 
\begin{equation}
v=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\varepsilon _{o}\mu _{o}}}
\end{equation}

We have studied waves, so we know the solution to this equation is a sine or
cosine function%
\begin{eqnarray}
E &=&E_{\max }\cos \left( kx-\omega t\right) \\
B &=&B_{\max }\cos \left( kx-\omega t\right)
\end{eqnarray}%
with 
\begin{equation*}
k=\frac{2\pi }{\lambda }
\end{equation*}%
and 
\begin{equation*}
\omega =2\pi f
\end{equation*}%
then 
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\omega }{k}=\frac{2\pi f}{\frac{2\pi }{\lambda }}=\lambda f
\end{equation*}%
which is the wave speed.

We can show that the magnitude of $E$ is related to $B$.

Lets take derivatives of $E$ and $B$ with respect to $x$ and $t.$%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{\partial E}{\partial x} &=&-kE_{\max }\sin \left( kx-\omega t\right) \\
\frac{\partial B}{\partial t} &=&\omega B_{\max }\sin \left( kx-\omega
t\right)
\end{eqnarray*}%
then we can use one of our half-way-point equations from above%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial E}{\partial x}\mathbf{=}-\frac{\partial B}{\partial t}
\end{equation*}%
and by substitution obtain%
\begin{eqnarray*}
-kE_{\max }\sin \left( kx-\omega t\right) &=&-\omega B_{\max }\sin \left(
kx-\omega t\right) \\
-kE_{\max } &=&-\omega B_{\max }
\end{eqnarray*}%
or%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{E_{\max }}{B_{\max }}=\frac{\omega }{k}=v
\end{equation*}%
The speed is the speed of light, $c$, so 
\begin{equation}
\frac{E_{\max }}{B_{\max }}=c
\end{equation}%
It is one of the odd things about the universe that speed of electromagnetic
waves is a constant. It does not vary in vacuum, and the in-vacuum value, $c$
is the maximum speed. It was a combination of Maxwell's work in predicting $%
c $ and the observations confirming the predictions that launched Einstein
to form the Special Theory of Relativity!

Note that the last equation shows why we often only deal with the electric
field wave when we do optics. Since the magnetic field is proportional to
the electric field, we can always find it from the electric field.

Knowing that the electric and magnetic fields form plane waves, we can
investigate these plane wave solutions to see what they imply.

\subsection{Energy in an EM\ wave}

The electromagnetic (EM) wave is a wave. Waves transfer energy. It is
customary find a vector that describes the flow of energy in the
electromagnetic wave. This is like the ray vectors we have been drawing for
some time, but with the magnitude of the vector giving the energy flow rate.

The rate of at which energy travels with the EM wave is given the symbol $%
\mathbf{S}$ and is called the Poynting vector after the person who thought
of it. It is 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{S}=\frac{1}{\mu _{o}}\mathbf{E}\times \mathbf{B}
\end{equation}%
Let's deal with a dumb name first: The Poynting vector. It is named after a
scientist with the last name Poynting. The name is really meaningless. There
is nothing particularly \textquotedblleft pointy\textquotedblright\ about
this vector more than any other vector.

Instead of a formal derivation, let's just see what we get from Poynting's
equation for a plane wave.

For our plane wave case, $E$ and $B$ are at $90\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{b0}}%
%BeginExpansion
{{}^\circ}%
%EndExpansion
}$ angles\footnote{%
For other fields this might not be true, but it is generally true for light.}%
. so 
\begin{equation}
S=\frac{1}{\mu _{o}}EB
\end{equation}%
and $S$ will be perpendicular to both. Notice from our preceding figures
that this is also the direction that the wave travels! That is comforting.
That should be true for a EM wave. The energy, indeed, goes the way the
Poynting vector points.

Using 
\begin{equation*}
\frac{E}{B}=c
\end{equation*}%
we can write the magnitude of the Poynting vector as%
\begin{equation}
S=\frac{E^{2}}{c\mu _{o}}
\end{equation}%
We could also express this in terms of $B$ only.

You will remember that our eyes don't track the oscillations of the
electromagnetic waves. Few detectors (if any) can. For visible light, the
frequency is very high. We usually see a time average. This time average of
the Poynting vector is called the \emph{intensity} of the wave%
\begin{equation*}
I=S_{ave}
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Intensity of the waves}

When we studied waves, we learned that waves have an intensity. The
intensity of electromagnetic waves must relate to the strength of the
fields. We can write it as%
\begin{equation*}
I=\frac{EB}{2\mu _{o}}
\end{equation*}%
(can you remember where the \textquotedblleft $1/2$\textquotedblright\ came
from?)\footnote{%
This is because the average value of $\sin ^{2}\left( \omega t\right) $ over
a period is given by $\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}\sin ^{2}\left( \omega t\right)
dt=\allowbreak \frac{\omega }{2\pi }\int_{0}^{\frac{2\pi }{\omega }}\sin
^{2}\left( \omega t\right) dt=\allowbreak \frac{1}{2}$}. Again using%
\begin{equation*}
E=cB
\end{equation*}%
we can write the intensity as%
\begin{equation}
I=\frac{1}{2\mu _{o}c}E^{2}
\end{equation}%
We remember that $I$ is proportional to the square of the maximum electric
field strength from our previous consideration of light intensity. But
before we only said that it was proportional. Now we know the constant of
proportionality. Of course we could also write the intensity as 
\begin{equation}
I=\frac{c}{2\mu _{o}}B^{2}
\end{equation}%
but this is less traditional. We have said already that the intensity, $I$,
is the magnitude of the average Poynting vector $S_{ave}.$

Recall that we know the energy densities in the fields%
\begin{eqnarray*}
u_{E} &=&\frac{1}{2}\varepsilon _{o}E^{2} \\
u_{B} &=&\frac{1}{2}\frac{B^{2}}{\mu _{o}}
\end{eqnarray*}%
again, since 
\begin{equation}
E=cB
\end{equation}%
we can write 
\begin{eqnarray}
u_{B} &=&\frac{1}{2}\frac{B^{2}}{\mu _{o}} \\
&=&\frac{1}{2}\frac{E^{2}}{c^{2}\mu _{o}}  \notag \\
&=&\frac{1}{2}\varepsilon _{o}E^{2}  \notag
\end{eqnarray}%
so for a plane electromagnetic wave 
\begin{equation}
u_{E}=u_{B}
\end{equation}%
The total energy in the field is just the sum%
\begin{equation}
u=u_{E}+u_{B}=\varepsilon _{o}E^{2}
\end{equation}%
But when we do the time average to find the intensity, we pick up a factor
of a half%
\begin{equation}
u_{ave}=\frac{1}{2}\varepsilon _{o}E^{2}
\end{equation}%
Comparing this to our equation for intensity gives%
\begin{equation*}
I=\frac{1}{2\mu _{o}c}E_{\max }^{2}=S_{ave}
\end{equation*}%
and then%
\begin{eqnarray}
S_{ave} &=&\frac{1}{\epsilon _{o}\mu _{o}c}\frac{1}{2}\epsilon _{o}E^{2} \\
&=&\frac{1}{\epsilon _{o}\mu _{o}c}u_{ave}  \notag \\
&=&\frac{1}{\frac{1}{c^{2}}c}u_{ave}  \notag \\
&=&cu_{ave}  \notag
\end{eqnarray}

Remember when you studied thermodynamics you, learned that we could transfer
energy by radiation. This is our radiation! And we see that it does indeed
transfer energy. We learned about this by discussing solar heating and by
talking about Army weapons that apply energy to crowds.\FRAME{dhF}{2.2813in}{%

when we microwave something. Microwaves are electromagnetic waves!

\subsection{Momentum of light}

One of the strangest things is that there is also momentum in the
electromagnetic waves. If the waves are absorbed, the momentum is 
\begin{equation}
p=\frac{U}{c}
\end{equation}%
or if the waves are reflected it is 
\begin{equation}
p=\frac{2U}{c}
\end{equation}%
(think of balls bouncing off a wall, the change in momentum is always $2mv).$

We can think of the light exerting a pressure on the surface. Force is given
by 
\begin{eqnarray*}
F &=&ma \\
&=&m\frac{dv}{dt} \\
&=&\frac{dp}{dt}
\end{eqnarray*}%
then using this force, the pressure is%
\begin{equation}
P=\frac{F}{A}=\frac{1}{A}\frac{dp}{dt}
\end{equation}%
then 
\begin{equation}
P=\frac{F}{A}=\frac{1}{cA}\frac{dU}{dt}
\end{equation}%
We found $\frac{1}{A}\frac{dU}{dt}$ to be the energy rate per unit area,
which is the magnitude of the Poynting vector, $S$. So our pressure due to
light is%
\begin{equation}
P=\frac{S}{c}
\end{equation}%
for perfect absorption. If there is perfect reflection%
\begin{equation}
P=\frac{2S}{c}
\end{equation}

This may seem a little strange. Water or sound waves would exert a pressure
because the water or air particles can strike a surface, exerting a force.
But remember the electromagnetic fields will create forces on the electrons
in atoms\footnote{%
Protons too, but the protons are more tightly bound due to the nuclear
strong force and the nuclei are bound in the material. their resonant
frequencies are usually not assessable to visible light, so I will ignore
their effect in our treatment. But if you consider x-rays or gamma rays,
they would be important.}, and most of the electrons are bound to the atoms
in materials by the Coulomb force. So there really is a force on the
material due to the electromagnetic wave. Quantum mechanics tells us about
electrons being knocked out of shells into higher energy shells (absorbing
photons of light) and re-emitting the light when the electrons fall back
down to lower shells. This is a little like catching a frisbee, and then
throwing it. Momentum is transferred both at the catch and at the release.

A cool use of this phenomena is called laser levitation

\FRAME{fhFU}{3.1695in}{2.4025in}{0pt}{\Qcb{Laser Levation (Skigh Lewis,

In the picture you are seeing a single small particle that is floating on a
laser beam. the laser beam is directed upward. The force due to gravity
would make the particle fall, but the laser light keeps it up!

\subsection{Antennas Revisited}

We talked about antennas before. Let's try to put all we have done together
to make a radio wave. First, we know from our analysis that we need changing
fields. Neither static charges, nor constant currents will do. If we think
about this for a minute, we will realize that the charges will \emph{%
accelerate}. Fundamentally, this is the mechanism for making EM waves.

The half wave antenna is simple to understand, so let's take it as our
example.\FRAME{dhF}{4.7668in}{2.2191in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language
"Scientific Word";type "GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio TRUE;display

"1";cropright "1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename
'N8ESDKC1.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}It is made from two long wires
connected to an alternating current source (the radio transmitter).The
charges are separated in the antenna as shown. But the separation switches
as the alternating current changes direction. The charges accelerate back
and forth, like a dipole switching direction. Radio people call this antenna
a \emph{simple dipole}.

Note the direction of the $E$ and $B$ fields. The Poynting vector is to the
right. The antenna field sets up a situation far from the antenna, itself,
where the changing electric field continually induces a magnetic field and
the changing magnetic field continually induces a changing electric field.
The wave becomes self sustaining! And the energy it carries travels outward.

Below you can see a graph of the sort of toroidal angular dependence of the
dipole antenna emission pattern.\FRAME{dtbpFUX}{3.531in}{2.354in}{0pt}{\Qcb{%

usually stand antennas straight up and down. Then the transmission travels
parallel to the Earth's surface, where receivers are more likely to be.

Speaking of receivers, of course the receiver works like a transmitter, only
backwards. The EM waves that hit the receiving antenna accelerate the
electrons in the wire of the antenna. The induced current passed through an
LRC circuit who's resonance frequency allows amplification of just one small
band of frequencies (the one your favorite radio station is using) and then
the amplified signal is sent to a speaker.

\section{The Electromagnetic Spectrum}

Maxwell predicted how fast his field waves would travel by finding the
linear wave equation from the fields and noticing the speed indicated by the
result. We have seen how he did this. The answer is 
\begin{equation}
v=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\varepsilon _{o}\mu _{o}}}
\end{equation}%
this speed is so special in physics that it get's its own letter 
\begin{equation}
c=2.99792\times 10^{8}\frac{\unit{m}}{\unit{s}}
\end{equation}%
which is of course the speed of light. In fact, that this was the measured
speed of light was strong evidence leading us to conclude that light was
really a type of these waves. There are a few more types of electromagnetic
waves. In the following chart you can see that visible light is just a small
part of what we call the \emph{electromagnetic spectrum.}\FRAME{dtbpFU}{%

The speed of light is always a constant in vacuum. This is strange. It
caused a lot of problems when it was discovered. 
\begin{equation}
v=f\lambda
\end{equation}%
or 
\begin{equation}
c=f\lambda
\end{equation}%
where we can see that for light and electromagnetic waves, knowing the
wavelength is always enough to know the frequency as well (in a vacuum).

As an example of what problems can come, let's consider a Doppler effect for
light. Remember for sound waves, we had a Doppler effect. We will have a
Doppler effect for electromagnetic waves too. But light does not change it's
speed relative to a reference frame. This is \emph{really weird}. The speed
of light in a vacuum is \emph{always }$c$--\emph{no matter what frame we
measure it in}.

Einstein's theory of Special Relativity is required to deal with this
constant speed of light in every reference frame. From Relativity, the
Doppler equation is 
\begin{equation}
f^{\prime }=f\frac{\sqrt{1+\frac{v}{c}}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v}{c}}}
\end{equation}%
or, if we let $u$ be the relative velocity between the source and the
detector, and insist that $u\ll c$%
\begin{equation}
f^{\prime }=f\left( \frac{c+u}{c}\right)
\end{equation}%
Where of course $f^{\prime }$ is the observed frequency and $f$ is the
frequency emitted by the source. This is usually written as%
\begin{equation}
f^{\prime }=f\left( 1\pm \frac{u}{c}\right)
\end{equation}%
but it is really the same equation\footnote{%
This equation is only really true for relative speeds $u$ that are much less
than the speed of light. Since is is very hard to make something travel even
close to to the speed of light, we will find it is nearly always true.}.
Just like with sound, we use the positive sign when the source and observer
are approaching each other.

This means that if things are moving closer to each other the frequency
increases. Think of 
\begin{equation}
\lambda =\frac{c}{f}
\end{equation}%
this means that as a source and emitter approach each other, then the light
will have a shorter wavelength. Think of our chart on the electromagnet
spectrum. This means the light will get bluer. If they move farther apart,
the light will get redder.

This is what gave us the hint that has lead to our cosmological theories
like the big bang. Although this theory is now much more complicated, the
facts are that as we look at far away objects, we see they are all \emph{red
shifted}. That is, they all show absorption spectra for known elements, but
at longer wavelengths that we expect from laboratory experiments. We
interpret this as meaning they are all going away from us!

\subsection{Summary}

Here is what we have learned so far about the properties of light

\begin{enumerate}
\item Electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light

\item Electromagnetic waves are transverse electric and magnetic waves that
are oriented perpendicular to each other.

\item $E=cB$

\item Electromagnetic waves carry energy $\emph{and}$ \emph{momentum}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Photons}

Our understanding of light is not complete yet. If you went on to take PH279
you would find that light still operates much like a particle at times. This
should not be a surprise, since Newton and others explained much of optics
(the study of light) assuming light was a particle.

Einstein and others noticed that for some metals, light would strike the
surface and electrons would leave the surface. The energy of a wave is
proportional to the amplitude of the wave. It was expected that if the
amplitude of the electromagnetic wave was increased, the number of electrons
leaving the surface would increase. This proved to be true most of the time.
But Hertz and others decided to try different frequencies of light. It turns
out that as you lower the frequency, all of a sudden no electrons leave no
matter how big the amplitude of the wave. Something was wrong with our wave
theory of light. The answer came from Einstein who used the idea of a
\textquotedblleft packet\textquotedblright\ of light to explain this \emph{%
photoelectric effect}. For now, we should know just that the waves of light
exist in \emph{quantized} packets called \emph{photons}. The energy of a
photon is 
\begin{equation}
E=hf
\end{equation}%
where $E$ is the energy, $f$ is the frequency of the light wave, and $h$ is
a constant%
\begin{equation}
h=6.63\times 10^{-34}\unit{J}\unit{s}
\end{equation}

A beam of light is many, many photons all superimposing. We know how waves
combine using superposition, so it is easy to see that we can get a big wave
from many little waves.

Knowing that light is made from electric and magnetic fields, and that these
fields are vector fields, we should expect some directional quality in
light. And there is such a directional quality that we will study next
lecture.

\begin{itemize}
\item The direction of the electric field in a plane wave is called the
polarization direction.

\item Natural light is usually a superposition of many waves with random
polarization directions. This light is called unpolarized light.

\item Some materials allow light with one polarization to pass through,
while stopping other polarizations. The polaroid is one such material
polaroids. will have a final intensity that follows the relationship $%
I=I_{\max }\cos ^{2}\left( \theta \right) $

\item Light reflecting off a surface may be polarized because of the
absorption and re-emission pattern of light interacting with the material
atoms.

\item Scattered light may be polarized because of anisotropies in the
scatterers.

\item Birefringent materials have different wave speeds in different
directions. This affects the polarization of light entering these materials.
\end{itemize}

\section{Polarization of Light Waves}

We said much earlier in our study of light that it was a transverse wave.
Last lecture we saw that we have an electric and magnetic field direction,
and that these directions are perpendicular to each other and the direction
of energy flow. We will now show some implications of this fact. In a course
in electromagnetic theory, we often draw light as in the figure below.\FRAME{%
dhF}{3.681in}{3.673in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language "Scientific

"1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename 'N8ESDKC4.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}%
We will continue to ignore the magnetic field (marked in the figure as $B$).
We will look at the $E$ field an notice that it goes up and down in the
figure. But we could have light in any orientation. If we look directly at
an approaching beam of light we would \textquotedblleft
see\textquotedblright\ many different orientations as shown in the next
figure.\FRAME{dtbpF}{1.5307in}{1.5895in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

'N8ESDKC5.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}

When light beams have waves with many orientations, we say they are \emph{%
unpolarized}. But suppose we were able to align all the light so that all
the waves in the beam were transverse waves in the same orientation. Say,
the one in the next figure.\FRAME{dhF}{0.3226in}{1.3508in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{%

'N8ESDLC6.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}

Then we would describe the light as \emph{linearly polarized}. The plane
that contains the $E$-field is known as the \emph{polarization plane}.

\subsection{Polarization by removing all but one wave orientation}

One way to make polarized light is to remove all but one orientation of an
unpolarized beam. A material that does this at visible wavelengths is called
a \emph{polaroid}. It is made of long-chain hydrocarbons that have been
treated with iodine to make them conductive. The molecules are all oriented
in one direction by stretching during the manufacturing process. The
molecules have electrons that can move when light hits them. They can move
farther in the long direction of the molecule, so in this direction the
molecules act like little antennas. The molecules' electrons are driven into
harmonic motion along the length of the molecule. This takes energy (and
therefore, light) out of the beam. Little electron motion is possible in the
short direction of the molecule, so light is given a preferential
orientation. The light is passed if it is perpendicular to the long
direction of the molecules. This direction is called the \emph{transmission
axis}.

We can take two pieces of polaroid material to study polarization.\FRAME{dhF%
}{3.7879in}{1.4088in}{0in}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language "Scientific
Word";type "GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio TRUE;display "USEDEF";valid_file

"1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename 'N8ESDLC7.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}

Unpolarized light is initially polarized by the first piece of polaroid
called the \emph{polarizer}. The second piece of polaroid then receives the
light. This piece is called the \emph{analyzer}. If there is an angular
difference in the orientation of the transmission axes of the polarizer and
analyzer, there will be a reduction of light through the system. We expect
that if the transmission axes are separated by $90\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{b0}}%
%BeginExpansion
{{}^\circ}%
%EndExpansion
}$ no light will be seen. If they are separated by $0\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{b0}}%
%BeginExpansion
{{}^\circ}%
%EndExpansion
},$ then there will be a maximum. It is not hard to believe that the
intensity will be given by%
\begin{equation}
I=I_{\max }\cos ^{2}\left( \theta \right)
\end{equation}%
remembering that we must have a squared term because $I\varpropto E^{2}.$

\subsection{Polarization by reflection}

If we look at light reflected off of a desk or table through a piece of
polaroid, we can see that at some angles of orientation, the reflection
diminishes or even disappears! Light is often polarized on reflection. Let's
consider a beam of light made of just two polarizations. We will define a
plane of incidence. This plane is the plane of the paper or computer screen.
This plane is perpendicular to the reflective or refractive surface in the
figure below.\FRAME{dhF}{2.5996in}{2.1906in}{0in}{}{}{Figure}{\special%
{language "Scientific Word";type "GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio

'N8ESDLC8.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}

One of our polarizations is defined as parallel to this plane. This
direction is represented by orange (lighter grey in black and white) arrows
in the figure. The other polarization is perpendicular to the plane of
incidence (the plane of the paper). This is represented by the black dots in
the figure. These dots are supposed to look like arrows coming out of the
paper.

When the light reaches the interface between $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ it drives
the electrons in the medium into SHM. The perpendicular polarization finds
electrons that are free to move in the perpendicular direction and
re-radiate in that direction. Even for a dielectric, the electron orbitals
change shape and oscillate with the incoming electromagnetic wave.

The parallel ray is also able to excite SHM, but a electromagnetic analysis
tells us that these little \textquotedblleft antennas\textquotedblright\
will not radiate at an angle $90\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{b0}}%
%BeginExpansion
{{}^\circ}%
%EndExpansion
}$ from their excitation direction. Think of little dipole radiators. We can
plot the amplitude of the electric field as a function of direction around
the antenna.\FRAME{dtbpFUX}{1.5939in}{1.0629in}{0pt}{\Qcb{Angular dependence

axis, the field amplitude is zero. This means that the wave really does not

angle the reflected beam will be completely linearly polarized.

We can predict this angle. Remember Snell's law.%
\begin{equation*}
n_{1}\sin \theta _{1}=n_{2}\sin \theta _{2}

Let's reliable the incidence angle $\theta _{1}=$ $\theta _{b}.$ We take $%
n_{1}=1$ and $n_{2}=n$ so%
\begin{equation*}
n=\frac{\sin \theta _{b}}{\sin \theta _{2}}

\theta _{b}+90\unit{%

\begin{equation*}
n=\frac{\sin \theta _{b}}{\cos \theta _{b}}
\end{equation*}%
but again we remember that 
\begin{equation*}
\tan \theta =\frac{\sin \theta }{\cos \theta }
\end{equation*}%
so%
\begin{equation}
n=\tan \theta _{b}
\end{equation}%
which we can solve for $\theta _{b}.$%
\begin{equation*}
\theta _{b}=\tan ^{-1}\left( n\right)

This phenomena is why we wear polarizing sunglasses to reduce glare.

\subsection{Birefringence}

Glass is an amorphic solid--that is--it has no crystal structure to speak
of. But some minerals do have definite order. Sometimes the difference in
the crystal structure creates a difference in the speed of propagation of
light in the crystal. This is not to hard to believe. We said before that
the reason light slows down in a substance is because it encounters atoms
which absorb and re-emit the light. If there are more atoms in one direction
than another in a crystal, it makes sense that there could be a different
speed in each direction.

Calcite crystals exhibit this phenomena. We can describe what happens by
defining two polarizations. One parallel to the plane of the figure below,
and one perpendicular.

'N8ESDLCB.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}With a careful setup, we can
arrange things so the perpendicular ray is propagated just as we would
expect for glass. We call this the $O$-ray (for \emph{ordinary}). The second
ray is polarized parallel to the incidence plane. It will have a different
speed, and therefore a different index of refraction. We call it the \emph{%
Extraordinary ray} or $E$-ray.

If we were to put a light source in a calcite crystal, we would see the $O$%
-ray send out a sphere of light as shown in the figure above. But the $E$%
-ray would send out an ellipse. The speed for the $E$-ray depends on
orientation. There is one direction where the speeds are equal. This
direction is called the \emph{optic axis} of the crystal.\FRAME{dhF}{2.3514in%

\subsection{Optical Stress Analysis}

Some materials (notably plastics) become birefringent under stress. A
plastic or other stress birefringent material is molded in the form planned
for a building or other object (usually made to scale). The model is placed
under a stress, and the system is placed between to polaroids. When
unstressed, no light is seen, but under stress, the model changes the
polarization state of the light, and bands of light are seen.\FRAME{dhF}{%

\subsection{Polarization due to scattering}

It is important to understand that light is also polarized by scattering. It
really takes a bit of electromagnetic theory to describe this. So for a
moment, lets just comment that blue light is scattered more than red light.
In fact, the relative intensity of scattered light goes like $1/\lambda
^{4}. $ This has nothing to do with polarization, but it is nice to know.

Now suppose we have long pieces of wire in the air, say, a few microns long.
The pieces of wire would have electrons that could be driven into SHM when
light hits them. If the wires were all oriented in a common direction, we
would expect light to be absorbed if it was polarized in the long direction
of the particles and not absorbed in a direction perpendicular to the
orientation of the particles. This is exactly what happens when long ice
particles in the atmosphere orient in the wind (think of the moment of
inertia). We often get impressive halo's around the sun due to scattering
from ice particles.

Rain drops also have a preferential scattering direction because they are
shaped like oblate spheroids (not \textquotedblleft rain drop
shape\textquotedblright\ like we were told in grade school).

It is also true that small molecules will act like tiny antennas and will
scatter light preferentially in some directions and not in others. This is
called \emph{Rayleigh scattering} and is very like small dipole antennas.

\subsection{Optical Activity}

Some substances will rotate the polarization of a beam of light. This is
called being \emph{optically active}. The polarization state of the light
exiting the material depends on the length of the path through the material.
Your calculator display works this way. An electric field changes the
optical activity of the liquid crystal. There are polarizers over the liquid
crystal, so sometimes light passes through the display and sometimes it is
black.

\subsection{Laser polarization}

One last comment. Lasers are usually polarized. This is because the laser
light is generated in a \emph{cavity} created by two mirrors. The mirror is
tipped so light approaches it at the Brewster angle. Light with the right
polarization (parallel to the plane of the drawing) is reflected back nearly
completely, but light with the opposite polarization is not reflected at
all. This reduces the usual loss in reflection from a mirror, because in one
polarization the light must be reflected completely.

\section{Making alternating current}

A few lectures ago, we studied the generator. But we found that a basic
generator, we got a sinusoidal potential difference%
\begin{equation}
\Delta V\left( t\right) =\Delta V_{\max }\cos \left( \omega t\right)
\end{equation}%
This sinusoidal potential will cause a sinusoidal current!%
\begin{equation}
i\left( t\right) =I_{\max }\cos \left( \omega t\right)
\end{equation}%
Note that this $\omega $ is just like the $\omega $ from our oscillating RLC
circuit. It is an angular frequency.%
\begin{equation}
f=\frac{\omega }{2\pi }
\end{equation}

This alternating voltage is really not like a battery, so we need a new
symbol for a source of alternating potential. We use a circle with a
squiggle in it

current or potential that varies. It is traditional to use small letters to
symbolize instantaneous values. We will do this, and we will explicitly
write The dependence on $t$. So 
\begin{equation}
\Delta v\left( t\right) =\Delta V_{\max }\cos \left( \omega t\right)
\end{equation}%
is the instantaneous electric potential from our alternating potential
source. We can plot the current and the potential difference to compare
them. \FRAME{dtbpF}{4.5467in}{2.1749in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

amplitudes, but they are in phase (remember that phase tells us when they
rise and fall, relative to each other).Thinking of Ohm's law, we would
expect the two curves to be proportional to each other. But we should be
cautious. The current and voltage both change in time. So we can't just
write 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=IR
\end{equation*}%
we need to specify which $\Delta V$ and which $I$ since each constantly
change. We will investigate a solution to this problem in our next lecture.

circuits with alternating emfs. We will find a convenient way to solve this
problem in this lecture. We will also set the groundwork for dealing with
more complicated circuit elements that change the relative phase between the
current and electric potential.

\section{Instantaneous current and potential}

To introduce alternating potentials, let's take a simple circuit as shown.%
\FRAME{dtbpF}{1.7495in}{2.1041in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language
"Scientific Word";type "GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio TRUE;display

'N8ESDLCI.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}} Kirchhoff's rule applies here
(no mysterious B-fields). But now our currents and potential differences are
time dependent. So Kirchhof's rules must apply for each instant of time.
Let's review Kirchhoff's rules. Recall that 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=-\doint \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{s}=L\frac{dI}{dt}
\end{equation*}%
The loop rule says that if we add up all the changes in electric potential
we get (assuming the inductance, $L,$ is small enought that we can ignore
it) 
\begin{equation}
\doint \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{s}\approx 0
\end{equation}%
And this is just 
\begin{equation*}
\sum \Delta V\approx 0
\end{equation*}%
We find for our simple circuit that 
\begin{equation}
\Delta v\left( t\right) +\Delta v_{R}\left( t\right) =0
\end{equation}%
note that these are instantaneous values. We recall that for the $emf$ 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta v\left( t\right) =\Delta V_{\max }\cos \left( \omega t\right)
\end{equation*}%
So, the magnitude of $\Delta v_{R}$ is also 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta v_{R}=\Delta V_{\max }\cos \left( \omega t\right)
\end{equation*}%
Now, using these instantaneous values, we can use Ohm's law%
\begin{equation*}
\Delta v\left( t\right) =i\left( t\right) R
\end{equation*}%
where $i$ is the instantaneous current.%
\begin{eqnarray}
i\left( t\right) &=&\frac{\Delta v_{R}\left( t\right) }{R}  \notag \\
&=&\frac{\Delta V_{\max }}{R}\cos \left( \omega t\right)
\end{eqnarray}%
we recognize $\Delta V_{\max }/R$ as a current, the maximum current.%
\begin{equation}
i\left( t\right) =I_{\max }\cos \left( \omega t\right)
\end{equation}%
%TCIMACRO{%
%\TeXButton{Question 220.35.4}{\marginpar {

%EndExpansion
This gives us an idea. If we use the maximum value for the potential and
current, then we can just use Ohm's law.%
\begin{equation}
\Delta V_{\max }=I_{\max }R
\end{equation}%
Now this \emph{does} work, but we should realize that the current is not at
it's maximum value for most of the time. We will want to choose a more
representative value.

\subsection{Power dissipated}

For example, we used to say that 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}=I^{2}R
\end{equation}%
now that is not true for alternating currents, but we can say%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}_{ave}=I_{rms}^{2}R
\end{equation}%
Note that this makes sense. The resister does not care which direction the
current flows ($I$ is squared in the power equation), but it does care that
there is less current than if we had a steady flow at $I_{\max }.$

use the connection we made in PH123 (or will make now) between circular
motion and oscillatory (sinusoidal) motion. Let's take a generic set of

Look at the projection $x$ of the point $P$ on the $x$ axis. Lets follow
this projection as $P$ travels around the circle. We find it ranges from $%
-x_{\max }$ to $x_{\max }.$ If we watch closely we how $x\left( t\right) $
varies as a function of time, we find that it's rate of change with respect
to time is zero at the extreme points and is a maximum in the middle. This
projection is given as the cosine of the vector from the origin to $P.$

This model, indeed fits our description of our instantaneous potential if we
have $\theta =\omega t$ as the time dependence of $\theta .$

A phasor is a representation of our time varying quantity as a vector
projection on an axis (the $y$-axis in this case) of a vector that rotates
around the axis with angular velocity equal to the angular frequency.

\section{AC Circuits and Capacitors}

\FRAME{dtbpF}{1.8723in}{2.2615in}{0in}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

Now let's consider what an AC circuit will do to a capacitor. Recall that a
capacitor will, after a time, stop a direct current. Recall that the reason
for this is that as charge builds up on the capacitor, new charges coming to
the capacitor are repelled by the charges already on the capacitor plates.
The charges on the plates form an electric field in the capacitor, so there
is an electric potential across the plates in the capacitor. This electric
potential grows with more charge (think of our water tank analogy). The
building potential difference across the capacitor opposes the flow of more
charge to the capacitor. Eventually the current just stops.

But now we have a potential due to our alternating emf that changes. Charge
starts to build on the capacitor, but then the emf potential switches. This
makes charge rush away from the capacitor. Again the potential switches at
the emf. So again the charge rushes to the capacitor. Current flows through
the whole circuit and never stops because we keep switching the direction of
the emf. Notice how different this is from a battery-capacitor circuit.
Eventually the current stops for the battery circuit. But for our
alternating emf, we really don't stop an alternating current with a
capacitor!

But the building and unbuilding of a potential difference in the capacitor
does slow the current some. If we plot the capacitor potential, $v_{C}\left(
t\right) $ and current, $i\left( t\right) ,$ we get a graph that looks like
this

\FRAME{dtbpF}{3.4974in}{1.7624in}{0in}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

Let's analyze this graph starting when the potential across the capacitor is
maximum. The capacitor is fully charged. So at this split instant of time no
current will flow. \FRAME{dtbpF}{3.2818in}{1.4724in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{%

'N8RHU500.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}But then the source emf voltage
starts to decrease. So charge will flow from the higher capacitor potential
back to the emf source because the source now has a lower potential. In the
graph you see that as we move from $t=0$ the capacitor voltage decreases and
the current increases, but it increases negatively. \FRAME{dtbpF}{3.524in}{%

At some point the capacitor is completely drained. So it has a potential of
zero volts. \FRAME{dtbpF}{3.2304in}{1.4511in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special%

totally reversed direction and is increasing in magnitude. So charge will
rush from the higher potential in the emf source to the capacitor. \FRAME{%

And we will fill the capacitor the opposite way we had it before. Where the
negative charge was, we will fill with positive charge and vice versa. At
some point, the capacitor will be full again \FRAME{dtbpF}{3.2925in}{1.4768in%

instant. This is when the capacitor potential is once again equal to the
source emf. But at this point the source emf again loses potential and
current begins to flow, but this time the other direction.\FRAME{dtbpF}{%

This process just keeps repeating itself.

Note that really what we are seeing is normal behavior for an $RC$ circuit.
It takes time for a capacitor to charge or discharge in an RC circuit. And
that is what is happening here. Let's apply our equations for the
alternating potential for this situation. The capacitor instantaneous
potential will be%
\begin{equation}
\Delta v_{c}\left( t\right) =\Delta V_{\max }\cos \omega t
\end{equation}%
and we know from our study of capacitors%
\begin{equation}
q=C\Delta v_{C}
\end{equation}%
so%
\begin{equation}
q\left( t\right) =C\Delta V_{\max }\cos \omega t
\end{equation}%
Of course we take a derivative to find the current%
\begin{equation}
i\left( t\right) =\frac{dq\left( t\right) }{dt}=-C\Delta V_{\max }\omega
\sin \omega t
\end{equation}%
It is traditional to rewrite this as 
\begin{eqnarray}
i\left( t\right) &=&-\omega C\Delta V_{\max }\cos \left( \omega t+\frac{\pi 
}{2}\right) \\
&=&I_{\max }\cos \left( \omega t+\frac{\pi }{2}\right)
\end{eqnarray}

If you have taken PH123 you immediately notice that the current, and the
potential difference across the capacitor are out of phase. Remember that
this means that they are both cosine functions, but one starts later than
the other. Since the shift is a positive $+\pi /2,$ the current is shifted
to the left, and that means that current is the one that starts earlier.

And that is just what our analysis of the circuit has found. The cosine
function for the current seems to start earlier than the cosine function for
potential (it is already a quarter of a cycle ahead when our graph starts!).
If these two cosine functions were angular measures, they would have a phase
difference of $90\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{b0}}%
%BeginExpansion
{{}^\circ}%
%EndExpansion
}.$ So we say that they are $90\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{b0}}%
%BeginExpansion
{{}^\circ}%
%EndExpansion
}$ out of phase. We can use our idea of phasors to draw this situation.%
\FRAME{dtbpF}{2.5314in}{1.9301in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

\begin{Note}
The voltage across a capacitor always lags the current by $90\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{b0}}%

}$ for AC currents.
\end{Note}

Since the capacitor is slowing the current, we can say that it acts much
like a resister for alternating currents. In fact, let's consider how the
capacitor slows the current. First, we can guess that as the capacitance
gets larger it takes longer to fill the capacitor, so there is less charge
build up for a given cycle, and therefore less potential difference in the
capacitor. It is the potential difference that slows down or \emph{impedes}
the current, so we can see that our new resistance-like-effect should be
inversely proportional to the capacitance. Let's give this new resistance to
alternating current the symbol $X_{C},$ so we can write%
\begin{equation}
X_{C}\propto \frac{1}{C}
\end{equation}%
We can also reason that the faster the potential swaps happen at the source,
the less the charge build-up will happen on the capacitor, so there will be
less potential to slow the current. Then the resistance like property of the
capacitor should be inversely proportional to the frequency of the
alternating voltage source%
\begin{equation}
X_{C}\propto \frac{1}{f}
\end{equation}%
We usually combine these two effects into one equation for $X_{C}$ 
\begin{equation}
X_{C}=\frac{1}{2\pi fC}=\frac{1}{\omega C}
\end{equation}%
The name given to this resistance like quantity, $X_{C},$ is the \emph{%
capacitive reactance}.

The wonderful thing about this new quantity is that it obeys Ohm's law like
a resistance!%
\begin{equation}
\Delta V_{C,rms}=I_{rms}X_{C}
\end{equation}%
well, OK we had to use the $rms$ value of $\Delta V$ and $I$, but that is
what our voltmeters and ammeters read for AC currents! so it is great that
it works out so simply!

Now we know what happens when we plug this in. The capacitor charges when
the current starts to flow. But the current from the transformer and diode
will reach a peak and start to fall off. When this happens, the capacitive
circuit will start to discharge, making the current drop much more slowly
that it did on the wall side of the transformer. We get something like this%

heavy (green) curve is the resulting current.

This current is much better, but still not great for audio systems. You
would hear an annoying hum on top of your beautiful Mormon Tabernacle Choir
music. A good audio system will have additional filter circuits to remove
the \textquotedblleft ripple\textquotedblright\ in the current that remains
from our power plug. But we have described what is usually in the little box
that you plug into the wall to power your electronics. The additional
filtering is often in the device.

We have learned that the capacitive reactance depends on the frequency of
the oscillation. If the frequency was very small, we would still get to zero
current in between current peaks. If the frequency is very large, then there
would be barely any time for decay, so the ripple would be small. This
implies that we can change the filter effect on AC if we change the
frequency. Alternately, we can leave the frequency at $60\unit{Hz}$ and
change the capacitor to get different response. We can pick out which
frequencies are left in the ripple.

Take for example this circuit\FRAME{dtbpF}{2.0276in}{0.9713in}{0in}{}{}{%

We would expect current to flow in the circuit, and the resistance, $R$,
will slow that flow. The capacitor will also slow this flow because it has a
capacitive reactance. The combined effect would be a little like having two
resisters in series, but where one resister's resistance depends on the
frequency of the alternating current.

Recall that if we have two resistances in series each has a voltage drop of $%
IR$\FRAME{dtbpF}{1.9088in}{0.9225in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

must equal the source voltage 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V_{bat}=IR_{1}+IR_{2}
\end{equation*}%
and we can see that if we lower the resistance of $R_{1}$ then the voltage
across $R_{2}$ will be larger.

Since $X_{C}=1/\left( \omega C\right) $ the reactance goes down as the
frequency increases. So as we measure the voltage across the capacitor, it
is like the resistance is lower for the capacitor at higher frequencies. The
voltage across the capacitor is 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V_{c}=I_{C}X_{C}
\end{equation*}%
so as $X_{C}$ goes down, so does the voltage. We have a higher voltage for
lower frequencies and a lower voltage for higher frequencies.

We can plot the voltage that leaves the circuit divided by the voltage that
we input into the circuit as a function of the frequency of the input AC. We
see that low frequencies get through the circuit just fine, but large
frequencies don't get through. \FRAME{dtbpF}{1.6533in}{1.4272in}{0in}{}{}{%

Thus, the circuit passes all the high frequencies (like those high notes
from the sisters in the MoTab) but removes low frequencies (like our $60%
\unit{Hz}$ hum).

Filter design can be very complicated. Notch filters pass a narrow band of
frequencies. Electrical engineers usually have course work in filter design.
Now days filtering is often done digitally by transforming the signal into
the Fourier domain, removing unwanted frequencies, and inverse transforming
back to the signal domain. This is great when you can, but if you want to
remove the annoying interference from the local business's radio signals, a
good hardware filter on your TV input is a wonderful thing.

This is something to think about as you design experiments. What electronic
noise may exist. What filter is built into your test equipment. You may want
to add a filter to eliminate the noise. Conversely, you may find that your
equipment's filter has removed the signal you wanted!

When we learned about inductors a few lectures ago, we found that we can
pretend that there is an emf induced in the inductor 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{E}_{L}=-L\frac{\Delta I}{\Delta t}
\end{equation}%
really there is an amount of energy tied up in making the magnetic field in
the inductor. But in this lecture, we will treat this just as though it were
a normal voltage.

We do need to rewrite this to match our AC notation%
\begin{equation}
\Delta v_{L}\left( t\right) =-L\frac{\Delta i\left( t\right) }{\Delta t}
\end{equation}%
to show time dependence. And we can use Kirchhoff's rules to find the
current and voltage as a function of time. Because of the inductor, this is
a little more difficult than the purely conductive circuit. But in going
around the loop we still have 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta v\left( t\right) +\Delta v_{L}\left( t\right) =0
\end{equation*}%
and we can write out $\Delta v_{L}\left( t\right) $ so that 
\begin{equation}
\Delta v\left( t\right) -L\frac{di\left( t\right) }{dt}=0
\end{equation}%
Using our equation for $\Delta v\left( t\right) ,$ we see that 
\begin{equation}
\Delta V_{\max }\cos \left( \omega t\right) =L\frac{di\left( t\right) }{dt}
\end{equation}%
this tells us that%
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta V_{\max }}{L}\cos \left( \omega t\right) dt=di\left( t\right)
\end{equation}%
and of course we can integrate both sides of the equation%
\begin{equation}
\int_{0}^{t}\frac{\Delta V_{\max }}{L}\cos \left( \omega t\right)
dt=\int_{0}^{I}di
\end{equation}%
The right hand side is just $I.$ So that%
\begin{equation}
I=\frac{\Delta V_{\max }}{L}\int_{0}^{t}\cos \left( \omega t\right) dt=\frac{%
\Delta V_{\max }}{\omega L}\sin \omega t
\end{equation}%
Again we will write this in terms of the cosine function so we can compare
our inductive circuit current to the resistive and capacitive circuit
currents.%
\begin{equation}
I=\frac{\Delta V_{\max }}{\omega L}\cos \left( \omega t-\frac{\pi }{2}\right)
\end{equation}%
Note again that the current has a phase constant, this time $-\pi /2.$

We should also remember that the induced emf will oppose the current, so it
slows down the current (it is a back emf). We immediately think of our
capacitive reactance and wonder if we can define an inductive reactance! 
%TCIMACRO{%
%\TeXButton{Question 220.37.2}{\marginpar {

%EndExpansion
And indeed we can%
\begin{equation}
X_{L}=2\pi fL=\omega L
\end{equation}%
Let's see if it makes sense. We expect the back emf to increase as $L$
increases. This is like placing a small battery in the circuit backwards. It
will slow the current. The back emf increases with $L$, so having the
resistance-like property increase with $L$ makes sense. Since the back emf
goes like $-L\frac{\Delta I}{\Delta t}$ we expect that the faster the
current changes, the more resistance-like behavior we will get, so our
reactance should increase with frequency. So this equation makes sense. Now
we can write an $AC$ version of Ohm's law for inductors%
\begin{equation}
\Delta V_{L,rms}=I_{rms}X_{L}
\end{equation}%
and we can immediately see that 
\begin{equation}
\Delta v_{L}=I_{\max }X_{L}\cos \omega t
\end{equation}%
which shows us the phase relationship between $i\left( t\right) $ and $%
\Delta v_{L}\left( t\right) .$ The phase difference of $-\pi /2$ says that
the current will now lag the voltage. \FRAME{dtbpF}{2.2396in}{1.9922in}{0pt}{%

To see why the current and potential are out of phase, consider point right
at $t=0.$ The potential of the inductor is largest when the change in $I$ is
largest. When the change is zero, we expect the potential to be zero.

It is tempting to treat all these circuit elements as reactances, and just
use our normal circuit theory to find the current or potential drops. We can
almost do this. If they were all resisters we would just add the resistances%
\begin{equation*}
R_{eq}=R_{1}+R_{2}+R_{3}
\end{equation*}%
but resisters do not alter the phase relationship between $\Delta V$ and $I.$
Capacitors and inductors do. So our alternating voltage drops won't all be
low or high at the same time. So we need a clever trick to find the total
reactance. This is where the idea of a phasor becomes useful. We can use our
knowledge of vector addition, and treat the potential drops like vectors!

Let's start with $i\left( t\right) $ and $\Delta v\left( t\right) $ as a
function of time. 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta v\left( t\right) &=&\Delta V_{\max }\cos \left( \omega t\right) \\
i\left( t\right) &=&I_{\max }\cos \left( \omega t+\phi \right)
\end{eqnarray*}%
where $\phi $ is the phase constant. So far $\phi $ has been $\pm \pi /2$ or 
$0$ depending on which circuit element we have.

Let's draw a phasor diagram for $i\left( t\right) $ and $\Delta v_{R}\left(
t\right) $

\FRAME{dtbpF}{1.8236in}{1.4644in}{0in}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

}.$ That is, the current leads the voltage. We already know where the
current is on our phasor diagram, It has to be in the same place for the
whole circuit because we have a series circuit. Therefore, the current must
be in the same spot on the phasor diagram for the capacitor as it is for the
resistor. So now we need to draw the voltage $90\unit{%

vectors. We can find a resultant vector that would represent what you would

We would still like to use Ohm's law for LRC circuits. We would need to give
a symbol for the resistance like quantity due to the inductor, resistor, and
capacitor. Let's use $Z.$ Then Ohm's law would look like%
\begin{equation}
\Delta V_{\max }=I_{\max }Z
\end{equation}%
where this $Z$ is like the total resistance. We can do this by taking the
magnitude of the resulting vector 
\begin{equation}
\Delta v_{\max }=\sqrt{\Delta v_{R}^{2}+\left( \Delta v_{L}-\Delta
v_{C}\right) ^{2}}
\end{equation}%
and using it in Ohm's law%
\begin{equation}
I_{\max }Z=\sqrt{\Delta v_{R}^{2}+\left( \Delta v_{L}-\Delta v_{C}\right)
^{2}}
\end{equation}%
We know that the same current must flow through the entire series circuit.
So we can write this as%
\begin{equation*}
I_{\max }Z=\sqrt{\left( I_{\max }R\right) ^{2}+\left( I_{\max }X_{L}-I_{\max
}X_{C}\right) ^{2}}
\end{equation*}%

I_{\max }Z=I_{\max }\sqrt{\left( \left( R\right) ^{2}+\left(
X_{L}-X_{C}\right) ^{2}\right) }
\end{equation*}%
\begin{equation*}
Z=\sqrt{\left( R\right) ^{2}+\left( X_{L}-X_{C}\right) ^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
so we can \textquotedblleft add\textquotedblright\ all the reactances
together! It is just a little bit harder than adding numbers! Since this is
the magnitude of the combined reactance we should also worry about a phase.%
\begin{eqnarray}
\psi &=&\tan ^{-1}\left( \frac{\Delta v_{L}-\Delta v_{C}}{\Delta v_{R}}%
\right) \\
&=&\tan ^{-1}\left( \frac{I_{\max }X_{L}-I_{\max }X_{C}}{I_{\max }R}\right)
\\
&=&\tan ^{-1}\left( \frac{X_{L}-X_{C}}{R}\right)
\end{eqnarray}%
and we see that the phase is just the same as the phase of the potential.

We call this combined reactance the \emph{impedance,} because it impedes or
opposes the AC current. Now suppose we don't have all three types of circuit
elements, can we describe an impedance? Sure! The following figure gives the
circuit elements present in a series circuit, their impedance, and the phase.%

\subsection{Resonance and LRC circuits again}

Remember that when a driven harmonic oscillator was driven at the natural
frequency we had resonance. Let's look at the current of our $RLC$ circuit.
It has an equation very like a harmonic oscillator. The current is given by%
\begin{equation}
I_{rms}=\frac{\Delta V_{rms}}{Z}
\end{equation}%
or 
\begin{equation}
I_{rms}=\frac{\Delta V_{rms}}{\sqrt{\left( R\right) ^{2}+\left(
X_{L}-X_{C}\right) ^{2}}}
\end{equation}%
When $X_{L}=X_{C}$ this will be a maximum. This is a form of resonance.
Starting with $X_{L}=X_{C}$, we can find the frequency that will be the
resonant frequency.%
\begin{eqnarray*}
X_{L} &=&X_{C} \\
2\pi fL &=&\frac{1}{2\pi fC}
\end{eqnarray*}%
then%
\begin{equation*}
f^{2}=\frac{1}{4\pi ^{2}LC}
\end{equation*}%
or%
\begin{eqnarray}
f &=&\sqrt{\frac{1}{4\pi ^{2}LC}}  \notag \\
&=&\frac{1}{2\pi \sqrt{LC}}
\end{eqnarray}

Why do we care? This is a tuning circuit used in radios! We can include a
variable capacitor or a variable inductor in the circuit, and make it
resonate with a desired frequency. Usually a variable capacitor is used. So
when you turn the dial on your radio to adjust the frequency, you are
changing the capacitance of a variable capacitor!

first we write the current as%
\begin{eqnarray}
I_{rms} &=&\frac{\Delta V_{rms}}{\sqrt{\left( R\right) ^{2}+\left(
X_{L}-X_{C}\right) ^{2}}} \\
&=&\frac{\Delta V_{rms}}{\sqrt{\left( R\right) ^{2}+\left( \omega L-\frac{1}{%
\omega C}\right) ^{2}}}  \notag \\
&=&\frac{\Delta V_{rms}}{\sqrt{\left( R\right) ^{2}+L^{2}\left( \omega -%
\frac{1}{\omega LC}\right) ^{2}}} \\
&&\frac{\Delta V_{rms}}{\sqrt{\left( R\right) ^{2}+\frac{L^{2}}{\omega ^{2}}%
\left( \omega ^{2}-\frac{1}{LC}\right) ^{2}}}
\end{eqnarray}%
and remember that 
\begin{equation}
\omega _{o}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}
\end{equation}%
is the natural frequency of oscillation for a RLC circuit. so 
\begin{equation}
I_{rms}=\frac{\Delta V_{rms}}{\sqrt{\left( R\right) ^{2}+\frac{L^{2}}{\omega
^{2}}\left( \omega ^{2}-\omega _{o}^{2}\right) ^{2}}}
\end{equation}%
Let's plot this for a few values%
\begin{equation*}
\begin{tabular}{l}
$L=50\times 10^{-6}\unit{H}$ \\ 
$C=2.0\times 10^{-9}\unit{F}$ \\

\section{Power in an AC Circuit}

Ideal capacitors and inductors store energy, but don't loose or dissipate
it. So they do not have a power output. Real capacitors and inductors will
have some resistance in their parts. But for now we will assume this is
small.

To find the average power loss in our LRC circuit, we will take 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}_{ave}=I_{rms}^{2}R
\end{equation}%
which is great because we can measure $I_{rms}$ directly from our $AC$
ammeter. Remember we also had a $DC$ power equation that had potential drop
in it. We got it by using Ohm's law%
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V_{R,rms}=I_{rms}R
\end{equation*}%
or%
\begin{equation*}
R=\frac{\Delta V_{R,rms}}{\Delta I_{rms}}
\end{equation*}%
then%
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{P}_{ave} &=&I_{rms}^{2}\frac{\Delta V_{R}}{\Delta I_{rms}} \\
&=&I_{rms}\Delta V_{R}
\end{eqnarray}%
We will write this equation in a funny way. \FRAME{dtbpF}{3.2621in}{1.5264in%
}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language "Scientific Word";type

1.4892in;cropleft "0";croptop "1";cropright "1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename
'N8ETG806.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}In our diagram, we see that $%
\Delta V_{R}$ is just the $x-$component of $\Delta V_{\max }.$ This is true
for our rms\ voltage as well (same triangle) so we can write%
\begin{equation}
\Delta V_{R_{rms}}=\Delta V_{rms}\cos \psi
\end{equation}%
then%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}_{ave}=I_{rms}\Delta V_{R_{rms}}\cos \psi
\end{equation}%
if you work with $AC$ circuits you might find $\cos \psi $ called the \emph{%
power factor}.

Note that I\ did not define the instantaneous power. We can certainly do
that 
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{P}_{inst} &=&i\Delta v=I_{\max }\cos \left( \omega t-\psi \right)
\Delta V_{\max }\cos \omega t \\
&=&I_{\max }\Delta V_{\max }\cos \left( \omega t-\psi \right) \cos \omega t 
\notag
\end{eqnarray}%
which is messy. With a trig identity, 
\begin{equation*}
cos\left( \omega t-\psi \right) =\cos \omega t\cos \psi +\sin \omega t\sin
\psi
\end{equation*}%
we can show that this is%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}_{inst}=I_{\max }\Delta V_{\max }\left( \cos \omega t\cos \psi
+\sin \omega t\sin \psi \right) \cos \omega t  \notag
\end{equation}%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}_{inst}=I_{\max }\Delta V_{\max }\cos ^{2}\left( \omega t\right)
\cos \psi -I_{\max }\Delta V_{\max }\sin \omega t\cos \omega t\sin \psi 
\notag
\end{equation}%
But we often are not able to view this because it changes so rapidly. Our
meters usually only take a time average. 
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{\bar{P}}=\int_{\text{many T}}I_{\max }\Delta V_{\max }\cos
^{2}\left( \omega t\right) \cos \psi dt-\int_{\text{many T}}I_{\max }\Delta
V_{\max }\sin \omega t\cos \omega t\sin \psi dt
\end{equation*}%
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{\bar{P}}=\frac{1}{2}I_{\max }\Delta V_{\max }\cos \psi -0
\end{equation*}%
or just 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{\bar{P}}=\frac{1}{2}I_{\max }\Delta V_{\max }\cos \psi +0
\end{equation}%
This is what a power meter would see.

\subsection{Power for an LRC circuit}

Now that we know about power in AC circuits, let's look at the power in an
LRC circuit as a function of $\omega .$ We just found that 
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{P}_{ave} &=&I_{rms}^{2}R \\
&=&\frac{\Delta V_{rms}^{2}R}{\left( R\right) ^{2}+\frac{L^{2}}{\omega ^{2}}%
\left( \omega ^{2}-\omega _{o}^{2}\right) ^{2}}  \notag
\end{eqnarray}%
It is convenient to rewrite this as%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}_{ave}=\frac{\Delta V_{rms}^{2}R\omega ^{2}}{\omega
^{2}R^{2}+L^{2}\left( \omega ^{2}-\omega _{o}^{2}\right) ^{2}}  \notag
\end{equation}%
If we plot the same values for the components in our LRC circuit, 
\begin{equation*}
\begin{tabular}{l}
$L=50\times 10^{-6}\unit{H}$ \\ 
$C=2.0\times 10^{-9}\unit{F}$ \\ 
$\Delta V_{rms}=5\times 10^{-3}\unit{V}$ \\ 
$\omega _{o}=1\times 10^{7}\frac{\unit{rad}}{\unit{s}}$%
\end{tabular}%
\end{equation*}%
we find that the power looks like this%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}_{ave}=\frac{\left( 5\times 10^{-3}\unit{V}\right) R\omega ^{2}}{%
\omega ^{2}R^{2}+\left( 5.0\times 10^{-6}\unit{H}\right) ^{2}\left( \omega
^{2}-\left( 1\times 10^{7}\frac{\unit{rad}}{\unit{s}}\right) ^{2}\right) ^{2}%
}  \notag

curve changes as a function of the resistance. The \textquotedblleft
sharpness\textquotedblright\ of the curve is described by the \emph{quality
factor} 
\begin{equation}
Q=\frac{\omega _{o}}{\Delta \omega }
\end{equation}%
This is often just called the \textquotedblleft Q\textquotedblright\ of the
curve. The $\Delta \omega $ is measured at the half power points. We can
find them

$\allowbreak $ 
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\mathcal{P}_{peak}}{2} &=&\frac{\frac{1}{2}\Delta V_{rms}^{2}R\omega

&=&\frac{\Delta V_{rms}^{2}}{2R}

\begin{equation}

^{2}R^{2}+L^{2}\left( \omega ^{2}-\omega _{o}^{2}\right) ^{2}}

\end{equation}%
There are four solutions, 
\begin{eqnarray}
\omega _{1} &=&-\frac{1}{2L}\left( R-\sqrt{4L^{2}\omega _{o}^{2}+R^{2}}%
\right) \\
\omega _{2} &=&\frac{1}{2L}\left( R-\sqrt{4L^{2}\omega _{o}^{2}+R^{2}}\right)
\\
\omega _{3} &=&-\frac{1}{2L}\left( R+\sqrt{4L^{2}\omega _{o}^{2}+R^{2}}%
\right) \\
\omega _{4} &=&\frac{1}{2L}\left( R+\sqrt{4L^{2}\omega _{o}^{2}+R^{2}}\right)
\end{eqnarray}%

\end{eqnarray}

Two of which are negative, so we will ignore them. The other two are
centered around $\omega _{o}=1\times 10^{7}\frac{\unit{rad}}{\unit{s}}$ as
we would expect. If we find the difference between the two%
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta \omega &=&\omega _{4}-\omega _{1} \\
&&\frac{1}{2L}\left( R+\sqrt{4L^{2}\omega _{o}^{2}+R^{2}}\right) -\left( -%
\frac{1}{2L}\left( R-\sqrt{4L^{2}\omega _{o}^{2}+R^{2}}\right) \right) \\
&=&\frac{1}{2L}R-\frac{1}{2L}\sqrt{4L^{2}\omega _{o}^{2}+R^{2}}-\left( -%
\frac{1}{2L}R-\frac{1}{2L}\sqrt{4L^{2}\omega _{o}^{2}+R^{2}}\right) \\
&=&\frac{1}{2L}R-\frac{1}{2L}\sqrt{4L^{2}\omega _{o}^{2}+R^{2}}+\frac{1}{2L}%
R+\frac{1}{2L}\sqrt{4L^{2}\omega _{o}^{2}+R^{2}} \\
&=&\frac{R}{L}
\end{eqnarray}

Now let's remember why we started this long mathematical mess. We wanted to
know the \textquotedblleft Q-factor\textquotedblright\ for our LRC power
curve. Since 
\begin{equation*}
Q=\frac{\omega _{o}}{\Delta \omega }
\end{equation*}%
then%
\begin{equation*}
Q=\frac{\omega _{o}L}{R}
\end{equation*}

For a radio, we want to adjust the resistance to be high and the inductance
to be low enough that only one radio station frequency can be heard at a
time. Because of this, the LRC\ circuit in a radio tuner is usually tuned by
changing the capacitance.

\section{Retrospective}

We have thought about many things in this class. It has been a class \emph{%
about} science. It has not been a class where we have tried to discover new
science, or practiced the scientific method. This is on purpose, this being
an engineering class designed to teach the principles of physics for use in
designing machines.

But we should pause to think, just for a moment, about the philosophy of
science. Is everything in these lectures true? We did not perform
experiments to show every principle we learned. So does it all work?

The answer is--maybe. Experiments have been done to show that the equations
we have learned work at least sometimes. But science is an inductive
process. We can't prove anything true with science. We can only prove things
false. So what we have studied is what has not been proven false, yet. Of
course, even then, we have taken approximations from time to time, but we
pointed these out along the way. You will know when the approximations will
fail, because we talked about their valid ranges.

It is important to remember that we are not done discovering new things, and
proving old things false. The laws of Newton are approximations that work at
low speeds. Relativity provides mechanical equations for very high speeds
(e.g. the satellite motion involved in the GPS\ system). But is Relativity
correct? We think it works pretty well, but really we don't know. We may
never know for sure. But we know it works within the range of things we have
tried.

There are physicists today that are working on a fundamentally new model of
the universe. It is called \textquotedblleft String
Theory\textquotedblright\ and it would replace most of our thoughts about
how matter is made and how it interacts. The equations would reduce to the
ones we used in class for the conditions we considered. That is because the
new equations have to match the results of the experiments that we have
already done or they can't be correct. But the explanations might be very
different.

Often, it is in using physics to build something that we learn about the
limitations of physical theory. You may be part of that process. It is a
happy process because extending our understanding allows us to build new
things. But don't be surprised if some of the things we learned in this
class are different by the time your children take their engineering physics
course. That is what we should expect of an inductive process.

It is also important to note that revealed truth is not an inductive
process. It is still not static (see article of faith 9), but it \emph{can}
prove something true as well as prove things false. I\ hope your FDSCI 101
experience gave you some insight into doing science as well as learning
about science.

Some members view science and revelation as in opposition. But I\ think they
are complementary. The scientific process allows us to eliminate things that
are not true, allowing us to follow D\&C 9:8 in preparation for seeking
revelation. During a recent convocation speech, Elder Scott described using
this process as a nuclear engineer during his engineering career . We can
use this combination in our personal lives as well. I hope you will consider
this in your careers and lives.

I have tried to give at least equal time to conceptual understanding and
mathematical solving. I hope you review and refresh the conceptual
understanding of the physics of what you build. Most of my industrial
career, we built what we designed very well. We always did our calculations
well. But we did, at times, build the wrong thing because the conceptual
basis of the design was wrong. Such mistakes are difficult to fix.
Conceptual understanding is a guiding principle for a successful design
career. I hope this class has contributed to that conceptual understanding.

Summary of Right Hand Rules

\section{PH121 or Dynamics Right Hand Rules}

We had two right hand rules on PH121 We didn't give them numbers back then,
so we will do that now.

\subsection{Right hand rule \#0:}

We found that angular velocity had a direction that was given by imagining
you grab the axis of rotation with your right hand so that your fingers seem
to curl the same way the object is rotating. Then your thumb gives the
direction of $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{\omega }}$

\FRAME{dhF}{2.5048in}{1.8165in}{0in}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language
"Scientific Word";type "GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio TRUE;display

right hand (sorry left handed people, you have to use your right hand for
this) in the direction of rotation. Then your thumb points in the direction
of the vector.

\subsection{Right hand rule \#0.5:}

To find the direction of torque, we used the following procedure

\begin{enumerate}
\item Put your fingers of your right hand in the direction of $\mathbf{\vec{r%
}}$\FRAME{dhF}{2.5719in}{1.8628in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language

\item Curl them toward $\mathbf{\vec{F}}$ \FRAME{dhF}{2.4016in}{1.5281in}{0pt%

\item The direction of your thumb is the torque direction \FRAME{dhF}{%

"1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename 'N8EUFBDQ.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}

\item The angle $\theta $ is the angle \emph{between }$\mathbf{\vec{r}}$ and 
$\mathbf{\vec{F}}$ \FRAME{dhF}{1.9285in}{1.8178in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special%
{language "Scientific Word";type "GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio

\end{enumerate}

The magnitude of the torque is 
\begin{equation*}
\tau =rF\sin \theta
\end{equation*}

\section{PH223 Right Hand Rules}

We have four more right hand rules this semester having to do with charges
and fields.

\subsection{Right hand rule \#1:}

From this rule we get the \textbf{direction of the force on a moving charged
particle} as it travels thorough a \textbf{magnetic field}.

This rule is very like torque. We start with our hand pointing in the
direction of $\mathbf{\vec{v}}.$ Curl your fingers in the direction of $%
\mathbf{\vec{B}.}$ And your thumb will point in the direction of the force.
The magnitude of the force is given by 
\begin{equation}
F=qvB\sin \theta
\end{equation}%
\FRAME{dhF}{1.7633in}{1.2435in}{0in}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language
"Scientific Word";type "GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio TRUE;display

"1";cropright "1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename
'N8EUFBDS.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}

\subsection{Right hand rule \#2:}

From this rule we get the direction of the force on current carrying wire
that is in a magnetic field.

This rule is very like right hand rule \#1 above. We start with our hand
pointing in the direction of $\mathbf{I}.$ Curl your fingers in the
direction of $\mathbf{\vec{B}.}$ And your thumb will point in the direction
of the force. The magnitude of the force is given by 
\begin{equation}
F=ILB\sin \theta
\end{equation}

\subsection{Right hand rule \#3:}

From this rule we get the \textbf{direction of the magnetic field that
surrounds a long current carrying wire}.

This rule is quite different. It is reminiscent of the rule for angular
velocity, but there are some major differences as well. The field is a
magnitude and a direction at every point in space. We can envision drawing
surfaces of constant field strength. They will form concentric circles
(really cylinders) centered on the wire. At any one point on the circle the
field direction will be along a tangent to the circle. The direction of the
vector is given by imaging you grab the wire with your right hand (don't
really do it). Grab such that your right thumb is in the direction of the
current. Your fingers will naturally curl in the direction of the field.%
\FRAME{dhF}{1.8618in}{1.844in}{0in}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language
"Scientific Word";type "GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio TRUE;display
"USEDEF";valid_file "T";width 1.8618in;height 1.844in;depth

"1";cropright "1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename
'N8EUFBDT.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}

\subsection{Right Hand Rule \#4:}

From this rule we get the \textbf{direction of the induced current when a
loop is in a changing magnetic field}.

This rule is only used when we have a loop with a changing external magnetic
field. The rule gives the direction of the induced current. The induced
magnetic field will oppose the change in the external field, trying to
prevent a change in the flux. The current direction is found by imagining we
stick our right hand into the loop in the direction of the induced field.
Keeping our hand inside the loop we grab a side of the loop. The current
goes in the direction indicated by our thumb.\FRAME{dhF}{2.3931in}{2.2068in}{%
0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\special{language "Scientific Word";type
"GRAPHIC";maintain-aspect-ratio TRUE;display "USEDEF";valid_file "T";width

2.2201in;cropleft "0";croptop "1";cropright "1";cropbottom "0";tempfilename
'N8EUFBDU.wmf';tempfile-properties "XPR";}}In the figure above, the external
field is upward but decreasing. So the induced field is upward. The current
flows because there is an induced $emf$ given by%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathcal{E} &=&-N\frac{\Delta \Phi }{\Delta t} \\
&=&-N\frac{\left( B_{2}A_{2}\cos \theta _{2}-B_{1}A_{1}\cos \theta
_{1}\right) }{\Delta t}
\end{eqnarray*}
